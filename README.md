## Overview

PACCA is a **secure, multi-agent AI workflow** that automates healthcare prior authorization reviews. It solves one of healthcare's most expensive bottlenecks ($50–100B annually in U.S. administrative overhead) by combining the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models with strict deterministic grading rubrics, dual-collection vector retrieval, and a HIPAA-conscious audit infrastructure.

Unlike basic "LLM-wrapper" approaches, PACCA grounds every decision in factual medical guidelines via Retrieval-Augmented Generation, escalates to specialist tiers using a 7-branch deterministic decision tree, and — beginning with v2.3 — applies **observability-driven harness engineering** to iterate the system itself.

**v2.3 introduces a methodology, not just features.** Every behavioral change to PACCA's agent harness ships as a one-file diff with a falsifiable predicted-impact contract that the next evaluation round verifies. The methodology is adapted from Lin et al., *Agentic Harness Engineering* (arXiv:2604.25850, 2026). The repository's `docs/` folder makes the discipline auditable from outside.

> **Governance context.** PACCA is a Class 2/3 enterprise agent operating inside a [**CRISP-AG**](https://drdavidreed.com/portfolio)-style governance envelope. CRISP-AG is an artifact-centered framework for enterprise agentic AI governance that sits *beneath* ISO/IEC 42001 and NIST AI RMF — the standards establish what governance must achieve; CRISP-AG specifies what the producible artifacts look like. The harness-engineering discipline documented in this repo is a concrete instance of CRISP-AG's **Orchestration Contract** artifact; the seven-branch escalation tree and Medical Director gate instantiate the **Delegation Authority Scoping** artifact applied to a healthcare domain. See [drdavidreed.com/portfolio](https://drdavidreed.com/portfolio) for the full white paper.

### The Problem

Prior authorization is one of healthcare's most measurable failures:

- **Providers** spend 34+ hours/week per practice on prior authorization workflows
- **Patients** face treatment delays averaging 2–3 days, with 29% of delays directly harming care
- **Payers** process 200+ million requests annually, mostly manually
- **Reviewers** use outdated guideline versions in 35% of cases, with decision quality varying 18–35% by individual

### The Solution

PACCA automates the workflow using a five-agent hierarchical architecture with deterministic safety controls:

1. **Evidence Aggregation** — synthesizes scattered clinical data into coherent narratives
2. **Clinical Classification** — complexity scoring, specialty routing, urgency assessment
3. **Decision Support (Tier 1)** — guideline-based recommendations with chain-of-thought reasoning
4. **Medical Director (Tier 2)** — invoked for ambiguous cases (confidence 0.90–0.95)
5. **Policy Evolution (Governance)** — proposes amendments based on human-override patterns; deploys only with Medical Director approval

**Eight production-grade safety properties:**

- JWT-authenticated provider dashboard with bcrypt password hashing
- Dual-collection ChromaDB: official guidelines vs. institutional-memory precedents
- Chain-of-thought reasoning with anti-hallucination, uncertainty-flagging, and escalation-trigger guards on every agent
- 7-branch escalation tree (4 pre-flight + 3 post-agent) — deterministic safety logic that overrides AI confidence on experimental treatments, rare conditions, conflicting guidelines, and prior denials
- Pre-write HIPAA audit trail with correlation-ID linked event pairs
- OpenTelemetry → Langfuse distributed tracing on every agent call
- Runtime-adjustable operational parameters (confidence thresholds, retry budget, autonomy switch) without server restart
- Three-stage governance pipeline for AI-proposed guideline amendments — meets FDA SaMD change-control intent

## Results

Numbers are *measured locally* (the unit and integration suites) or *clearly labeled as benchmark/simulated* where they reflect synthesized cases rather than production traffic. The repository ships with no real PHI, so all clinical numbers come from the 53-case synthesized demo dataset and the 20-case clinical golden set.

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| **Unit tests** | 120 / 120 passing | `pytest tests/unit` — 7.14s |
| **Total tests across tiers** | 146 (unit + integration + clinical) | `pytest tests/ --collect-only` |
| **Clinical-accuracy CI gate** | ≥80% pass rate on 20-case golden set, LLM-as-judge (Claude Haiku, 1–5 rubric) | `tests/clinical/`, fails the build below threshold |
| **Hallucination tolerance** | **Zero** — sparse-notes traps GC-018, GC-019 fail the build on any score-1 hallucination | `tests/unit/test_clinical_accuracy.py` |
| **Lint posture** | `ruff check src/ tests/` — clean | CI lint job |
| **Median decision latency** *(benchmark, single-process)* | ~2.1 s | Synthesized 53-case run, Sonnet 4 |
| **95p decision latency** *(benchmark, single-process)* | ~4.3 s | Same |
| **Auto-approval rate** *(synthesized dataset)* | 28% (15 / 53 cases) | Group A — complete documentation, explicit guideline alignment |
| **Human-review rate** *(synthesized dataset)* | 19% (10 / 53 cases) | Group B — missing documentation, hallucination traps |
| **Pre-flight escalations triggered** *(synthesized dataset)* | 32% (17 / 53 cases) | Groups D–G — experimental treatment, rare condition, conflicting guidelines, prior denial |
| **Cost per decision** *(simulated, Sonnet 4 at current pricing)* | ~$0.04 | Token-counted per case; pricing as of 2026-05 |
| **Harness iterations recorded** | 2 (`harness-iter-0` baseline, `harness-iter-1` first extraction) | `harness/manifests/iter-{0,1}.json` |
| **Methodology source** | Lin et al., *Agentic Harness Engineering* | [arXiv:2604.25850](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.25850) |

> **What is *not* measured yet:** sustained-load latency, aggregate cost-per-decision at production volume, and adversarial prompt-injection resistance. These land in Phase H5 (Evaluation Harness Expansion). See [`docs/EVALUATION.md`](docs/EVALUATION.md) for the methodology and the gap list.

---

## Harness Engineering

> *Beginning with v2.3, PACCA is iterated using a structured, falsifiable methodology. Every behavioral change is a one-file diff with a recorded prediction. The next evaluation round verifies the prediction. Rejected changes are reverted at file granularity.*

The methodology adapts the AHE paper's three observability pillars to a healthcare domain:

| Pillar | PACCA Implementation |
|--------|----------------------|
| **Component observability** | 11 editable harness surfaces (7 NexAU-standard + 4 PACCA-specific), each at a fixed file path with one-file-diff rollback |
| **Experience observability** | OpenTelemetry spans → Langfuse + structured trajectory logs alongside the HIPAA audit trail |
| **Decision observability** | Every change ships with a [`change_manifest`](harness/manifests/change_manifest.schema.json) entry; verdicts logged in [`DECISIONS.md`](docs/DECISIONS.md) |

### The Four Harness Engineering Documents

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| 📐 **[`docs/HARNESS.md`](docs/HARNESS.md)** | Architectural reference. The seven AHE component types plus PACCA's four healthcare-specific harness surfaces, with rules for editing each. |
| 📋 **[`docs/DECISIONS.md`](docs/DECISIONS.md)** | Append-only log of every behavioral change with predictions and verified outcomes. The audit trail of the iteration cycle itself. |
| 📖 **[`docs/ITERATIONS.md`](docs/ITERATIONS.md)** | Narrative log per iteration tag. Format borrowed from the AHE paper's Appendix C — failure pattern → change → trajectory before/after → eval delta. |
| 🔒 **[`harness/manifests/change_manifest.schema.json`](harness/manifests/change_manifest.schema.json)** | JSON Schema 2020-12 specification for change manifests. Includes PACCA-specific fields (`phi_impact`, `audit_relevant`) tying the discipline to healthcare governance requirements. |

### v2.3 Cycle Phases

The v2.3 release commits PACCA to a six-phase cycle over 10–12 weeks. Each phase has explicit exit criteria verifiable from git history and the evaluation suite:

| Phase | Name | Weeks | Constraint Levels |
|-------|------|-------|-------------------|
| **H0** | Baseline Crystallization | 1–2 | Instrumentation only |
| **H1** | Component Decoupling | 3–4 | system_prompt, tool_description, tool_implementation |
| **H2** | Institutional Memory Layer | 5–6 | long_term_memory |
| **H3** | Cross-Step Middleware Tier | 7–8 | middleware |
| **H4** | Change Manifest Discipline | 3–10 (parallel) | Process layer |
| **H5** | Evaluation Harness Expansion | 10–12 | Eval infrastructure |

Full phase specifications, exit criteria, expected impact, and AHE paper citations are in **[the consolidated PRD §15](docs/PACCA_PRD_v2.3_Consolidated.md)**.

- **Decision Support Agent (Tier 1, "Frontline UM Nurse")**: evaluates clear-cut cases, auto-approves at confidence ≥ 0.95
- **Medical Director Agent (Tier 2, "Chief Medical Director")**: clinical nuance and gray areas before human routing
- **Policy Evolution Agent (Governance)**: proposes guideline amendments based on human-override patterns

### 📋 Clinical Decision Support

- RAG-powered guideline retrieval using ChromaDB dual-collection
- Evidence-based recommendations with confidence scores
- Transparent decision rationale, audit-logged
- Step therapy and prior treatment requirement support

### 👥 Human Oversight

- Configurable confidence thresholds for autonomous decisions
- 7-branch escalation tree with 4 pre-flight deterministic checks (experimental treatment, rare condition, conflicting guidelines, prior denial)
- Medical Director review interface with AI-generated case summaries
- Complete audit trail for regulatory compliance

### 📚 RAG and Institutional Memory

- **`nccn_guidelines`** — authoritative clinical guidelines (NCCN, CMS, AHA, ADA, ACR), quarterly updates, independent versioning and rollback
- **`case_precedents`** — Medical Director override decisions with documented rationales, embedded immediately, surfaced in semantically similar future cases
- v2.3+ adds per-agent `long_term_memory.md` files: human-readable, git-versioned cross-cutting clinical lessons that ride in the prompt context on every request (Phase H2)

### 🛡️ Production-Grade Safety

- **Anti-hallucination guards** on every agent ("only reference clinical evidence explicitly present in the submission")
- **Hallucination zero-tolerance tests** (GC-018, GC-019) — sparse-notes traps that fail the build on any score-1 hallucination
- **Tool-use API forced** for structured output — eliminates the most common agentic failure mode
- **Pre-write audit trail** — correlation-ID-linked event pairs flushed before any state change
- **JWT + bcrypt + fail-fast SECRET_KEY validation** — server refuses to start with weak or missing keys
- **Append-only PolicyChangeLogEntry** — immutable record of every guideline amendment, mapped to FDA SaMD Action Plan change-control requirements

### 🔧 Production-Ready Architecture

- FastAPI backend with full async support
- React 18 frontend with real-time updates
- PostgreSQL 16 for persistence, SQLite for development (one env-var switch)
- Dual-collection ChromaDB with metadata filtering
- OpenTelemetry → Langfuse distributed tracing (Docker Compose included)
- Comprehensive test coverage: 120 unit tests, 0 failures, ~7 seconds (146 total across unit, integration, and clinical-accuracy tiers)

## Demo Scenarios

PACCA includes 53 synthesized cases across 8 groups (A–H) covering all 7 escalation branches:

| Group | Cases | Scenario |
|-------|-------|----------|
| A | 15 | Auto-approved — complete documentation, explicit guideline alignment |
| B | 10 | Human review — missing documentation, hallucination traps |
| C | 8 | MD escalation — cost > $100K or borderline confidence |
| D | 5 | Experimental treatment pre-flight — CAR-T, gene therapy |
| E | 4 | Rare condition pre-flight — Gaucher, Huntington, ALS, Wilson disease |
| F | 4 | Conflicting guidelines pre-flight — NCCN vs. CMS vs. payer LCD |
| G | 4 | Prior denial pre-flight — resubmissions, fraud patterns |
| H | 3 | Precedent-based approvals — institutional memory in action |

Plus a 20-case clinical golden dataset with LLM-as-judge scoring (Claude Haiku, 1–5 rubric) and a CI gate at ≥80% accuracy. Hallucinations score automatic 1 — there is no acceptable rate of inventing clinical data.

In v2.3 Phase H5, these case sources are unified into a single benchmark of 100+ cases with k=2 rollouts per case and pass@1 / tokens-per-case / Succ/Mtok metrics.

- **[`harness/manifests/iter-N.json`](harness/manifests/)** — per-iteration manifest entries
- **[`harness/manifests/iter-N-verdicts.json`](harness/manifests/)** — per-iteration verdict files (CI-generated)

### Governance framework (external)

- **[CRISP-AG White Paper v2.3](https://drdavidreed.com/portfolio)** — *CRISP-AG: An Artifact-Centered Framework for Enterprise Agentic AI Governance.* Specifies the four implementation artifacts (Delegation Authority Scoping, Contractor Access Governance, Orchestration Contract, Capability Frontier Classification) and nine-phase lifecycle that PACCA's harness engineering implements at the code layer. Sits beneath ISO/IEC 42001 and NIST AI RMF.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. PACCA's contribution model has two paths:

- **Standard PRs** — refactors, documentation, infra, dependency bumps, non-behavioral fixes.
- **Behavioral PRs (harness-engineering discipline)** — anything that changes how an agent reasons, what tools it can call, what middleware fires, or what memory context it sees. Requires a one-file diff plus a manifest entry under [`harness/manifests/`](harness/manifests/).

Full details on local setup, the two-path workflow, the manifest schema, and the predicted-vs-observed verdict cycle are in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md). Security-related findings should follow [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) instead — please do not open a public issue.

By contributing you agree to the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
