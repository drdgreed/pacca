    """
    A brand-new session bound to `bind`, for callers that need a write to
    commit on its own, independent of whatever request-scoped transaction
    the caller is also participating in.

    `bind` MUST be the engine backing the CALLER's own session — pass
    `caller_session.bind`, never the process-global default-settings
    engine from `get_engine()` / `get_session_factory()`. Those return
    whatever `settings.database_url` points at; the caller's own session
    may be bound to a *different* engine (a dedicated test engine, a
    future read replica, any multi-engine context). Deriving the bind
    from the caller is what guarantees the independent write lands in the
    SAME database as the business write it accompanies — using the global
    engine instead would silently split them across two databases. (This
    was CRITICAL 2 in the chg-23 Validator review: an earlier version of
    this function always called `get_session_factory()`, so in any
    context where the caller's session used a non-default engine, audit
    writes went to `settings.database_url` while the business write went
    wherever the caller's session actually pointed.)

    This exists for `AuditRepository.log()`: an audit row written on the
    request's own session is rolled back along with the business
    transaction if the request later fails (see `get_session()` above) —
    exactly the case an audit trail must survive. A session from this
    function is bound to the same engine/pool as the caller but opens its
    own connection and transaction: committing it here does not depend
    on, and is not undone by, a rollback on the caller's session.

    Unlike `get_session()` / `get_session_context()`, this does NOT
    commit or roll back on the caller's behalf — the caller must commit
    explicitly. That's deliberate: the caller (audit write) needs to
    observe and handle its OWN commit failure without that failure
    propagating as an uncaught exception out of a `yield`.

        async with get_independent_session(caller_session.bind) as session:
