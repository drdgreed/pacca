        submission. It fired only in the evaluation harness, where golden cases
        hand it the codes directly. The detector's own docstring describes this

        **PHI boundary.** This deliberately reads rows belonging to OTHER
        authorization requests, which is a genuine widening of what a single run

        visible only inside the still-open transaction, so when
        `get_session()`'s except-clause ran `await session.rollback()`
        after an unhandled exception, the flushed-but-uncommitted audit row
        was rolled back along with the failed business write — a failed
        request left ZERO audit rows, defeating the point of a pre-write
        audit trail for the one case (a crash) it exists to cover.

        Ordering guarantee — read precisely, it is weaker than the same-
        transaction guarantee it replaces, and it is CONDITIONAL on the
        caller's session shape: this method awaits COMMIT of the audit
        row before returning, so "this call returns" happens only after
        "the audit row is durably in the database" — and therefore before
        the caller's subsequent business write is even attempted. It does
        NOT provide snapshot/serializable ordering against a concurrent
        reader on a third connection, and it does NOT make the audit
        commit part of the same atomic unit as the business write — that
        atomicity is exactly what we removed on purpose, since it was the
        thing letting a business rollback take the audit row down with
        it. The two writes are ordered-but-not-atomic:
        audit-committed-before-business-attempted, never
        audit-lost-because-business-failed —
        PROVIDED `self.session` is bound to an `AsyncEngine` (true for
        every production call site: `get_session()` / `get_session_context()`
        both build sessions from `async_sessionmaker(bind=engine, ...)`).
        If `self.session` is instead bound to an `AsyncConnection` directly
        (a connection-bound session — the standard "one shared connection,
        roll everything back at the end" transactional-test pattern) or has
        no bind at all, `_persist_independently` REFUSES the write and logs
        `audit_independent_session_unsupported_bind` loudly rather than
        silently degrading: a session built from a shared connection would
        commit as a SAVEPOINT nested in the caller's own transaction, so a
        later rollback on the caller's session would erase the "independent"
        row too — the exact silent-fallback failure mode (plausible success,
        real work didn't happen) this fix exists to eliminate, not
        reintroduce. See `_persist_independently`'s docstring.

        `request_id` no longer carries a foreign key to
        `authorization_requests` (chg-23 migration 007 drops the migration
        003 / B3 deferrable FK — see that migration's docstring for why: a
        deferred FK only worked because the audit write and the parent row
        shared one commit, which committing audit rows independently
        deliberately breaks. An append-only audit table should not have
        its rows' survival depend on referential integrity to a mutable
        business table it is meant to outlive). The column and its index
        remain — `request_id` is still a plain queryable value, just no
        longer FK-enforced.

        A failure of the independent write is logged loudly via
        `logger.error` — never swallowed silently — and does NOT raise: an
        audit-write problem must never turn a working request into a 500.
        Connection reuse: `get_independent_session()` draws from the same
        engine/pool the caller's own session already uses, so no new
        engine is opened per audit record — though each call does open one
        extra pooled connection (see the pool-cost note on
        `_persist_independently`).

        """Commit a DB-bound COPY of `entry` on its own session; see
        `log()`'s docstring for the durability/ordering guarantee.

        Deliberately builds and persists a separate `AuditLogModel`
        instance rather than adding `entry` itself to a session: once an
        ORM instance is added to a session and that session's commit fails
        (e.g. any real DB error) or the session merely closes, SQLAlchemy
        expires the instance's attributes, and reading them afterward
        without a live session raises `DetachedInstanceError` — silently
        turning "log a failure" into "raise a NEW, unrelated exception
        from the caller's return path" (this was flagged in the chg-23
        Validator review as the poisoned-return finding, surfaced via the
        now-removed request_id FK retry, but the same risk exists for
        ANY commit failure, FK-related or not). `entry`, the object
        returned to callers, is never added to a session and therefore
        never expires — it stays a safe-to-read transient object for the
        lifetime of the process, independent of whether the DB write
        underneath it ever succeeded.

        Pool cost: this opens one extra pooled connection per audit call
        (measured: 7 audit calls on the submit route's happy path -> 7
        extra checkouts per request, on top of the caller's own session's
        connection). With the default `db_pool_size=5, db_max_overflow=10`
        (`pacca/config/settings.py`), concurrent load exhausts the pool
        past roughly ~15 simultaneous requests, and further audit writes
        block for up to `db_pool_timeout` (30s) waiting for a connection
        rather than failing fast. This is a known, documented operating
        constraint, not a latent surprise — if it becomes a real
        bottleneck, the fix is a dedicated (larger, or separately pooled)
        connection allowance for audit writes, not attempted here to keep
        this change to the durability fix it was scoped for.

        Bind guard (chg-23 Validator FIX 1/2): `get_independent_session`
        needs `self.session`'s bind to be an `AsyncEngine` — a session
        built from an `AsyncConnection` bind instead shares that ONE
        connection with the caller, so its `commit()` degrades to a
        SAVEPOINT nested inside the caller's own transaction, and a later
        rollback on the caller's session erases it too. Silently
        attempting the write in that shape would return normally with the
        row gone and zero errors logged — a fallback that reports success
        while the real work didn't happen, the exact pattern this fix
        exists to remove, not reintroduce. `getattr(..., "bind", None)`
        (rather than direct attribute access) also makes a bindless
        session (`.bind is None`, e.g. `async_sessionmaker()` with no
        engine at all) an explicit, named case instead of an incidental
        `AttributeError` caught by the generic handler below.
