"""
PACCA FastAPI application — v2.2.0

Application startup, middleware configuration, and core auth endpoints.

Architecture notes:
  - All database operations use the async session from db/session.py.
    Schema (including the `users` table — migration 004) is built by Alembic
    migrations (C5 — the single schema source), applied before the app starts:
    docker-entrypoint.sh runs `alembic upgrade head` in containers; run
    `make db-upgrade` once for local dev outside Docker. The app itself no
    longer calls `create_all` at runtime. All route handlers are fully async.

  - JWT authentication uses SECRET_KEY loaded from the environment.
    The application validates SECRET_KEY at startup and refuses to start
    if it is missing or too short (< 32 characters).

  - OpenTelemetry is configured at startup via the lifespan context manager.
    Spans are exported to OTEL_ENDPOINT if set, otherwise printed to console.
