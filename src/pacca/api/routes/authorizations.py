"""
Authorization routes for the PACCA API.

This module handles prior authorization submission, status retrieval,
decision explanation, human review submission, and the learning feedback
loop (Level 4 / Level 5 architecture).

Audit logging is wired at every significant action so that every
authorization event is traceable for HIPAA compliance and debugging.

Teaching note — why audit logging matters here:
  HIPAA Security Rule 164.312(b) requires that any system touching
  Protected Health Information (PHI) maintains audit controls that
  record and examine system activity. Prior authorization requests
  contain PHI (patient IDs, diagnosis codes, clinical notes). Every
  submission, decision, override, and learning event must be logged.
