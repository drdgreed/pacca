"""Minimum-necessary scope guard (P-4 / chg-8).

Expresses the HIPAA *minimum-necessary* standard in code: for a given run, may
this *action*, for this *purpose*, on this *resource* proceed? The answer is
read from the run's declared ``IntentRecord`` (P-3) — the guard grants nothing
on its own.

Because PACCA has no middleware layer yet (a roadmap component), this is a
call-site **wrapper**, not middleware: each guarded tool/DB/RAG call passes
through ``enforce_scope`` before it runs. Every evaluation appends a
``scope.allow`` / ``scope.deny`` audit event (arg **names**, never values — no
PHI in audit details). A denial raises ``ScopeViolation``; the route catches it
and fail-closes the run to human review (``EscalationReason.SCOPE_VIOLATION``).

Two modes, per PACCA's trust-the-eval doctrine: ``warn`` audits a would-be
denial but lets the call proceed (one eval round to surface false denials);
``enforce`` raises. All rules are fail-closed — an unknown action, a mismatched
identifier, or a missing collection all deny.
