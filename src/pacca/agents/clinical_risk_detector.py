Clinical Risk Detector — pre-flight escalation check for the Orchestrator.

This module implements the four new escalation branches specified in PRD SS5.4:
  - Experimental treatment detection
  - Rare condition (ICD-10 prevalence) detection
  - Conflicting guidelines detection
  - Prior denial on same service detection

Architecture teaching note — why a separate class instead of putting
this logic directly in the Orchestrator?

  The Single Responsibility Principle: each class should have one reason
  to change. The Orchestrator's reason to change is "the workflow changed."
  The ClinicalRiskDetector's reason to change is "our clinical risk criteria
  changed." By separating them:

  1. You can test every detection rule in complete isolation — no mocks
     of agents or databases needed.
  2. You can update clinical criteria (e.g. add new experimental drugs to
     the list) without touching the orchestration workflow.
  3. A compliance auditor can read this file alone to understand all the
     conditions that trigger human review.

Teaching note — pure functions vs. database queries:
  Several of these checks (experimental treatment, rare conditions) use
  curated lists defined right here in the module. You might wonder: why
  not store these in the database and query them dynamically?

  Answer: configuration that affects clinical safety decisions should be
  version-controlled alongside the code that uses it. A database row can
  be changed by anyone with DB access; a Python file requires a code
  review and a deployment. For clinical escalation criteria, that friction
  is a feature, not a bug. The lists below change slowly (quarterly at
  most) and every change should be reviewed.

        Matching strategy: prefix matching on ICD-10 code.

        Teaching note — why prefix matching?
          ICD-10 codes are hierarchical. "E70" means "Disorders of aromatic
          amino-acid metabolism." "E70.0" is phenylketonuria specifically.
          "E70.1" is tyrosinemia. All E70.x codes represent rare metabolic
          disorders. Matching on the prefix catches all specificity levels
          in a single check, which is more maintainable than listing every
          possible E70.x code.

          The trade-off: a prefix check could catch a non-rare condition if
          a rare prefix is more specific than expected. In practice, the
          prefixes in RARE_CONDITION_ICD10_PREFIXES were chosen to correspond
          to disease families that are uniformly rare. Any false positive

        Teaching note — this is a heuristic, not a certainty:
          The keyword check is a signal, not a guarantee. "Not recommended
          for patients under 18" in a guideline about an adult patient is
          a false positive — the restriction doesn't apply. A production
          system would use a more sophisticated NLP approach (e.g. sentence-
          level sentiment analysis, or structured extraction of guideline
          recommendations). For this portfolio project, the heuristic
          approach demonstrates the pattern and the intent. The important
          engineering principle is that the Orchestrator is structured to
          receive this signal; upgrading the detection algorithm is a
          localized change to this one function.

          False positives (unnecessary human review) are acceptable.

        Strategy: exact match of current procedure code against the list of

        Teaching note — where does prior_denial_codes come from?
          In this prototype, the Orchestrator passes an empty list by default.
          In a production system, the route handler would query the
          AuthorizationRepository for prior decisions matching this patient ID
          and procedure code with status=DENIED, then pass those codes here.

          That query is the right place to add this: in the route, before
          calling process_decision(), something like:
            prior_denials = await auth_repo.get_denied_procedure_codes(
                patient_id=request.patient_id
            )
          This is a straightforward extension to AuthorizationRepository
          and is designed as a Week 3 enhancement.

          The important point is that the Orchestrator and ClinicalRiskDetector
          are already structured to receive and act on this information — the
          interface is ready even if the data source is not yet wired.
