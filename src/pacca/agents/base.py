"""
Base agent class for all PACCA AI agents.

This module provides the foundation that every agent inherits. It handles
three concerns that are common to all agents:
  1. LLM API communication (Claude via the Anthropic async client)
  2. Retry with exponential backoff (via tenacity)
  3. OpenTelemetry span instrumentation (one span per LLM call)

Teaching note — why put retry and tracing in the base class?

  The alternative is putting them in each agent individually. That means
  every agent — DecisionAgent, MedicalDirectorAgent, EvidenceAgent,
  ClassificationAgent — needs identical retry and tracing boilerplate.
  If you later want to change the retry configuration, you change it in
  four places. If you forget one, that agent silently has different behavior.

  The base class pattern (also called the "Template Method" pattern) says:
  define the common algorithm once, let subclasses fill in the specifics.
  The "specifics" here are: system_prompt (what role does this agent play?)
  and name (what is it called in logs?). Everything else — how to call the
  LLM, how to retry, how to trace — is defined once here.

Teaching note — tenacity retry strategy

  The retry decorator we use is:
    @retry(
        stop=stop_after_attempt(N),       # Give up after N total tries
        wait=wait_exponential(min=1, max=30),  # Wait 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s... up to 30s
        retry=retry_if_exception_type(RETRIABLE_ERRORS),  # Only retry these
        before_sleep=log_retry_attempt,   # Log each retry
        reraise=True,                     # After all attempts, re-raise the last error
    )

  The wait_exponential strategy means:
    Attempt 1: fails → wait 1 second
    Attempt 2: fails → wait 2 seconds
    Attempt 3: fails → re-raise (or wait 4 seconds if max_attempts=4)

  This is respectful to the API: if it's struggling (rate limited, overloaded),
  waiting longer between retries gives it time to recover rather than hammering
  it with immediate retries.

Teaching note — what errors are retriable vs. not?

  RETRIABLE (transient — will likely succeed on retry):
    - 429 RateLimitError — too many requests, wait and retry
    - 500/502/503/504 APIStatusError — server-side errors, transient
    - APIConnectionError — network blip
    - APITimeoutError — request timed out

  NOT RETRIABLE (permanent — retrying won't help):
    - 400 BadRequestError — we sent invalid data; retrying sends the same bad data
    - 401 AuthenticationError — wrong API key; retrying with the same key fails again
    - ValueError from our own parsing — our code has a bug, not the API

  Retrying non-retriable errors wastes time and obscures the real problem.

Teaching note — OpenTelemetry span attributes

  Each span we create has attributes attached:
    span.set_attribute("agent.name", "DecisionAgent")
    span.set_attribute("model", "claude-sonnet-...")
    span.set_attribute("attempt_number", 1)
    span.set_attribute("input_tokens", 450)
    span.set_attribute("output_tokens", 120)

  These attributes are what make traces searchable and useful. In Langfuse
  or Jaeger, you can filter: "show me all agent calls where output_tokens > 500"
  or "show me all calls that hit attempt_number 2 or 3" (those are your
  retried requests — you want to know how often that happens).
