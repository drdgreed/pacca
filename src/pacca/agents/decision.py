"""
Decision Support Agent (Tier 1) and Medical Director Agent (Tier 2).

These are the two core clinical reasoning agents in PACCA:

  DecisionSupportAgent (Tier 1 — Frontline UM Nurse):
    Handles every case that passes pre-flight checks. Returns a
    confidence score and rationale. High confidence → auto-approve.
    Ambiguous → escalate to Medical Director Agent.

  MedicalDirectorAgent (Tier 2 — Chief Medical Director):
    Handles cases the Tier 1 agent found ambiguous (confidence 0.90–0.95).
    Has clinical authority to resolve nuance and interpret gray areas.
    Produces a definitive determination with high confidence, or routes
    to human review if uncertainty genuinely persists.

Both agents use the full structured prompt template from prompts/templates.py,
including the shared CLINICAL_SAFETY_GUIDELINES anti-hallucination instructions.
Prompt versions are tracked in PROMPT_REGISTRY for audit trail purposes.
