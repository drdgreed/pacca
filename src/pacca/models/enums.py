"""
Enumeration types for the PACCA domain model.

Teaching note — why use enums instead of plain strings?
  Strings like "IN_REVIEW" or "experimental_treatment" can be mistyped
  anywhere in the codebase and the error only appears at runtime. Enums
  make typos a Python import error — the mistake is caught immediately.
  They also make the audit log self-documenting: when you see
  EscalationReason.EXPERIMENTAL_TREATMENT in a record, you know exactly
  what it means and where to find its definition.

        escalated due to experimental treatment this quarter?")
