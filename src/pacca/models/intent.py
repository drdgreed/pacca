"""Per-run IntentRecord (harness change P-3 / chg-7).

A typed, audited contract declared at the very start of every prior-authorization
run: what the run is permitted to touch and what effect it should have. It is
**record-only** — no enforcement lives here. The orchestrator/route appends it as
the first audit event (`action="intent.declared"`); later governance changes
(P-4 minimum-necessary scope guard, P-5 evidence-grounding detector) read it and
cite it in their findings.

Concept imported from CausalGate's typed intent contract, scoped to what is
meaningful for PACCA: the per-request purpose is fixed (prior-auth adjudication),
so the informative fields are the *scope* (collections/actions) and the
*expected effects*.

The `allowed_*` / `expected_effects` / `limits` values have no runtime capability
source today, so they are declared constants here (this module is their SSOT).
When a real capability/RBAC source exists, `for_prior_auth` reads from it instead.
