"""
GuidelineRetriever — production RAG interface for PACCA.

This module provides the primary interface for clinical guideline
retrieval. It wraps RAGPipeline (the richer, production-grade
implementation) while maintaining backward-compatible method names
so all existing routes and agents continue to work without changes.

Architecture history (important context for reviewers):
  The original implementation in this file was a direct ChromaDB
  wrapper — functional but without chunking, metadata filtering,
  cosine similarity scoring, or relevance thresholds.

  rag/pipeline.py was written with all those features but was never
  wired as the active production path. Routes imported GuidelineRetriever
  from this file; RAGPipeline sat unused.

  v2.2 resolution: GuidelineRetriever now delegates to RAGPipeline
  internally. The public API is unchanged (same method signatures,
  same return types). The retrieval quality is now backed by the
  full pipeline with chunking and cosine similarity scoring.

  This is the Adapter design pattern: GuidelineRetriever is the
  stable interface that the rest of the codebase depends on;
  RAGPipeline is the implementation that does the actual work.

Teaching note — why not just change the import in routes?

  `routes/authorizations.py` currently imports:
    from ...integrations.vector_store import GuidelineRetriever

  We could change that import to use RAGPipeline directly. But:
    1. Other files may import GuidelineRetriever (admin.py, tests)
    2. Changing imports across multiple files is higher risk than
       upgrading the implementation behind one stable interface
    3. The Adapter pattern is the right design: the interface is
       a contract; changing the implementation behind it is safe

  The single place to change retrieval logic is now this file.
