"""
OpenTelemetry tracer setup and span utilities for PACCA.

This module is the single place that owns OTel configuration. Agents and
routes import `get_tracer()` and `record_span_error()` from here —
they never interact with the OTel SDK directly. This isolation means:
  - Swapping the OTel exporter (Langfuse → Jaeger → Tempo) is a change
    in this one file
  - Disabling tracing entirely (e.g. in unit tests) is a single flag
  - The rest of the codebase never has to know whether OTel is active

Teaching note — what is a tracer and what is a span?

  A TRACER is a factory that creates spans. You get one per module:
    tracer = get_tracer("pacca.agents.decision")

  A SPAN is a named unit of work with a start time, end time, and
  key-value attributes. You open one when work begins, close it when
  work ends. The OTel SDK records the timing automatically.

    with tracer.start_as_current_span("llm_call") as span:
        span.set_attribute("agent.name", "DecisionAgent")
        result = await call_llm(...)
        span.set_attribute("confidence_score", result.confidence)

  Spans automatically nest. If a parent span is active when you open
  a child span, the SDK links them — building the full trace tree:

    http_request
      └── authorization_submit
            ├── rag_query [45ms]
            └── agent_decision [320ms]
                  └── anthropic_api_call [315ms]

  This tree is what you see in a trace viewer like Langfuse or Jaeger.

Teaching note — why a no-op tracer fallback?

  In unit tests and environments without OTel configured, we return a
  no-op tracer that accepts all the same method calls but does nothing.
  This means agent code doesn't need any `if tracing_enabled:` guards —
  it always calls `tracer.start_as_current_span(...)` and the tracer
  decides whether to record it. Clean separation of concerns.
