# CLAUDE.md — PACCA Agent Context

Project memory for any coding agent (Claude Code or otherwise) working in this repo.

## What PACCA is

PACCA (Prior Authorization & Care Coordination Agent Platform) is a multi-agent AI
system that automates healthcare prior-authorization decisions. It is RAG-grounded,
harness-engineered, and observability-first. Healthcare domain: PHI handling and audit
integrity are non-negotiable, not nice-to-haves.

Stack: Python 3.12 + FastAPI (async), Pydantic v2, PostgreSQL 16 / SQLite (dev),
ChromaDB (**dual-collection**: `nccn_guidelines` + `case_precedents`, via the live
`integrations/vector_store.py` — see the RAG note below), React 18 + Vite frontend,
OpenTelemetry spans (Langfuse export intended), Claude (`claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`,
the `settings.anthropic_model` default) with
tool-use forced for structured output.

## The one rule that governs every behavioral change

**Every change that alters agent behavior ships as a one-file diff with a recorded,
falsifiable prediction.** Behavioral = how an agent reasons, what tools it can call,
what middleware fires, or what memory context it sees. This discipline is the point of
the project; do not bypass it to "save time."

Before a behavioral change:
1. Read `docs/HARNESS.md` and identify the correct constraint level (one of the
   currently-built harness surfaces — see the PR template enum for the canonical list).
2. Make the change as a one-file diff. If multiple components are touched, use multiple
   commits — one file per commit.
3. Use the `chg-N:` commit prefix for behavioral changes (conventional commits otherwise:
   `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`).
4. Add a matching entry to `harness/manifests/iter-N.json` per
   `harness/manifests/change_manifest.schema.json`. Include `phi_impact` and
   `audit_relevant` fields — they are required for healthcare governance.
5. Record the verdict. **Two artifacts, two purposes — this instruction used to name only
   the second, which is why it decayed:**
   - **Structured verdict → `harness/manifests/iter-N.json`, `verdicts[]`** (`change_id`,
     `outcome` of keep/improve/rollback, `verified_fixes`, `missed_fixes`, `notes`), recorded at
     the next evaluation round. This is the SSOT and is schema-validated by the required
     `validate-manifests` CI check.
   - **Narrative entry → `docs/DECISIONS.md`**, a `## iter-N — <title>` section holding what a
     schema cannot: why the iteration was shaped as it was, what an unexplained red test meant,
     what the evaluation could *not* establish. Enforced by
     `tests/harness/test_decisions_log_coverage.py`, which fails when a manifest has no matching
     section.

   Both are required. The narrative log previously stopped at iter-14 while manifests ran to
   iter-24 — not from neglect but from enforcement asymmetry: one had a schema, a validator and
   a CI gate, the other was prose. It is now gated too. (`docs/ITERATIONS.md` is a third,
   older narrative log, stalled at iter-7; revive-or-retire is an open decision and it is NOT
   currently required.)

> **Enforcement status — P-6 complete, with one bypass (verified 2026-07-29).** CI runs a
> **`validate-manifests`** job (`python -m pacca.harness.validate_manifest --all`, every PR)
> and a **`clinical-gate`** job (GC-018/019 + golden-set accuracy via `make test-clinical`,
> on `chg-`/agent-rag PRs and nightly). The PR template still forces the
> Standard-vs-Behavioral choice. Both of David's manual steps are **done**: the
> `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` repo secret exists (set 2026-07-23; the nightly run's clinical gate
> passes, so it is live, not inert), and `main` carries branch protection with **five
> required status checks** — `Tests`, `Validate change manifests`,
> `Clinical gate (GC-018/019 + accuracy)`, `Lint & Type Check`, and
> `Postgres integration (SQLite-masked bugs — B2/B3)`. A missing manifest now blocks a
> merge, not just a job.
>
> **The bypass is CLOSED as of 2026-08-01.** `enforce_admins` is now **true**: the five
> required checks apply to everyone, including admins, and there is no longer a path that
> lands code on `main` without them. Before that it was false, and an admin push skipped
> all five — GitHub printed "5 of 5 required status checks are expected" and accepted the
> push anyway. That path was used on 2026-07-29 to land a 118-commit local backlog, which

>

> is false, so a branch need not be current with `main` before merging; a change can pass
> against a stale base.

Non-behavioral changes (refactors, docs, test additions that don't change behavior)
follow the standard PR flow and skip the manifest. The PR template forces the choice —
every PR is one path or the other, never ambiguous.

## Where things live (don't reorganize without reason)

- `src/pacca/agents/` — the agents. **As built**, two agents have their own directory:
  `decision_support/` (`system_prompt.md` + `long_term_memory.md`) and `medical_director/`
  (`system_prompt.md`). The other three are flat modules: `evidence_agent.py`,
  `classification_agent.py`, and `evolution.py`. Wiring is by direct
  Python import, not an `agent.yaml` loader. The per-agent seven-component layout
  (`tool_descriptions/`, `tools/`, `middleware/`, `agent.yaml`) is **roadmap** — see below.
- `src/pacca/agents/prompts/templates.py` — shared `PROMPT_REGISTRY`. Prompts are
  versioned (`v{MAJOR}.{MINOR}`, surfaced to audit logs and OTel spans). Register a
  prompt; don't hardcode one at a call site.
- `src/pacca/agents/orchestrator.py` (class `Orchestrator`) — the 7-branch escalation
  tree (4 pre-flight deterministic checks + 3 post-agent). This logic OVERRIDES model
  confidence. Treat it as a safety boundary, not a suggestion.
- `src/pacca/models/intent.py` — the per-run **`IntentRecord`** (governance rollout P-3):
  a typed, record-only contract (allowed collections/actions, opaque subject_ref,
  expected effects) that the submit route emits as the FIRST audit event
  (`intent.declared`). It is the SSOT for a run's declared scope; P-4/P-5 read it.
- `src/pacca/agents/scope_guard.py` — the **minimum-necessary scope guard** (P-4):
  `enforce_scope(intent, action, **call_args)`, a fail-closed call-site *wrapper*
  (there is no middleware loader) that denies out-of-scope tool/DB/RAG calls against
  the `IntentRecord` and raises `ScopeViolation` → `EscalationReason.SCOPE_VIOLATION`.
  **As built (chg-8 → chg-9, +1 at chg-20, +1 at chg-22, +1 at chg-32):** wired into the
  submit route in **enforce** mode at six sites — four in `submit_authorization` itself and two
  in the escalation helpers it calls (`_handle_rag_degraded_escalation`,
  `_persist_scope_violation_escalation`), extracted at chg-24. chg-32 added
  `db.read_prior_denials`, the first READ in the scope and the first guarded call touching rows
  outside the current request. Four identifier-checked DB writes
  (`db.write_request`; `db.write_decision` at the normal-flow persist; again at the
  RAG-degraded escalation persist; again at the scope-violation escalation persist) and
  the RAG query. `learn_from_feedback` carries a sixth site (`rag.write_precedent`) under
  its own intent. A cross-case leak fail-closes to human review. In correct operation
  the run always passes its own scope, so it does not deny in normal flow — its value is
  fail-closed defense against a leak/bug. Mode is `settings.scope_guard_mode`.
- `src/pacca/integrations/vector_store.py` — `GuidelineRetriever`, the **live**
  RAG interface. It is **dual-collection and built**: `nccn_guidelines` (authoritative)
  and `case_precedents` (institutional memory — Medical Director overrides written by
  `/feedback`, retrieved on submit under a "PAST MEDICAL DIRECTOR DECISIONS" header the
  DecisionAgent prompt weighs). Both collections are governed by the P-4 scope guard
  (iter-13): `RAG_COLLECTIONS` is the SSOT the `IntentRecord` allow-list mirrors.
- `src/pacca/rag/pipeline.py` — `GuidelineVectorStore` + `RAGPipeline`: chunking,
  embedding, ingest and cosine-scored retrieval. **Live.** It was dead until the
  import chain was repaired (missing `ClinicalSpecialty`/`TreatmentCategory` enums,
  the `uuid7` → `uuid_extensions` module name); the bare `except ImportError` in
  `integrations/vector_store.py` swallowed that and fell back forever. It no longer
  names a collection of its own — `GuidelineRetriever` injects the governed
  collection it already holds, so there is no ungoverned `clinical_guidelines` store.
- Span emission lives in `src/pacca/agents/base.py` + `src/pacca/config/tracing.py`
  (one span per agent call). There is **no** `src/pacca/observability/` package.
- `src/pacca/api/`, `src/pacca/db/`, `src/pacca/models/`, `src/pacca/config/` — standard.
- `src/pacca/db/migrations/` — Alembic migrations are the **single source of truth** for
  the schema (C5). The app no longer calls `create_all` at startup; `docker-entrypoint.sh`
  runs `alembic upgrade head` before uvicorn (run `make db-upgrade` for local dev). `env.py`
  combines BOTH declarative Bases' metadata (`db.models.Base` + `api.database.Base`) so
  `users` is migration-covered (migration 004). A `migration-drift` CI job asserts models ≡
  migrations on Postgres. Don't reintroduce `create_all` on a runtime path.
- `.githooks/pacca_guard.py` — the **PHI/secret pre-commit guard** (wired via
  `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, reusing `sme_authoring/validators.py` as SSOT, tested in
  `tests/unit/test_pacca_guard_hook.py`). This is PACCA's strongest existing example of a
  deterministic commit-time gate — the pattern to imitate when adding enforcement.
- `harness/manifests/` — change manifests + verdicts. The decision record of iteration.
- `docs/` — `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `HARNESS.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `ITERATIONS.md`,
  `EVALUATION.md`, consolidated PRD.

## Safety invariants — never weaken these

- **Anti-hallucination guards.** Agents may only reference clinical evidence explicitly
  present in the submission. Golden cases **GC-018** and **GC-019** (in
  `tests/clinical/golden_cases.py`) assert zero score-1 hallucination. As of P-6 the
  `clinical-gate` CI job runs these (on `chg-`/agent-rag PRs and nightly), and as of
  2026-07-29 it is a **required status check** on `main` — a failure blocks a PR merge
  (though an admin direct-push still bypasses it; see the enforcement note above). P-5
  (chg-10) also promotes this guard to a **runtime** detector (`evidence_grounding.py`):
  a decision citing an evidence id absent from the submission is forced to human review.
- **Coverage determinations yes; medical-necessity determinations never (2026-07-31).**
  PACCA may conclude that a **documented, objective coverage criterion is unmet** and
  `DENY` on that basis — a benefit cap exhausted, an indication absent from the NCCN
  compendium, a required prior step not documented, a re-request carrying no new
  evidence, an NCD's own stated condition unmet. Every such denial must cite the
  **specific unmet criterion** and the **appeal / exception pathway**.
  It must **never** conclude that a service is *not medically necessary for this
  patient*. Any conclusion requiring a judgment about severity, appropriateness, or
  risk/benefit routes to human review.
  **The operational test:** is the unmet criterion checkable from the record without
  clinical judgment? "Is this indication in the compendium?" is a lookup. "Is there new
  evidence since the prior denial?" is a diff. "Does this patient need proton beam?" is
  medical necessity — never PACCA's call. Where a criterion is stated in the record it
  is documentary; where PACCA would have to *derive* it (deducing risk stratification
  from Gleason/PSA/stage, or judging whether a finding constitutes a contraindication),
  it is clinical, and the case escalates.
  This boundary is regulatory as well as architectural — adverse medical-necessity
  determinations in utilization review are generally reserved to a licensed clinician,
  so confirm the specific requirement with counsel for any deployment jurisdiction.
  Encoded at `src/pacca/agents/decision_support/long_term_memory.md` L318-323 (the
  medical-necessity carve-out) and analysed in `docs/EVALUATION.md` ("DENY-class
  baseline"). David's decision; do not widen it without his.
- **Tool-use forced** for structured output. Don't switch an agent to free-text parsing.
- **Pre-write audit trail — ordering AND durability (chg-23).** Correlation-ID-linked event
  pairs (`AuditLogModel` carries `correlation_id`) are written BEFORE any state change;
  `tests/unit/test_audit_trail.py` guards the ordering. Don't reorder writes ahead of the
  audit write.
  **Durability is now real, and it was not before.** `AuditRepository.log()` commits on a
  session bound to the caller's own engine, independently of the business transaction — so
  a rolled-back request can no longer erase the record that documents it. Two consequences
  that are load-bearing: (1) `audit_logs.request_id` carries **no foreign key** (migration
  007 dropped the deferrable FK from migration 003) — an append-only audit row must not
  depend on a business row it is meant to outlive, and pre-write auditing is structurally
  incompatible with a parent-row constraint; (2) a non-`AsyncEngine` bind is **refused
  loudly** (`audit_independent_session_unsupported_bind`) rather than silently degrading to
  savepoint semantics. Verified on real Postgres: 7/7 route audit rows persist with
  `request_id` intact, and pre-write rows survive a business rollback.
- **Append-only policy change log.** The intent is that policy changes are never mutated
  or deleted. **As built** this is a prototype: `PolicyChangeLogEntry` (in
  `agents/evolution.py`) is an in-memory dataclass list, not a DB table
  (see Limitations). Preserve the append-only *contract* in code; the durable-persistence
  piece is roadmap.

## Testing

Use the Makefile targets (they encode the correct markers):

- **Deterministic suite (routine):** `make test` — runs `pytest tests/unit/` plus the
  non-clinical part of the clinical accuracy test, with `-m "not clinical and not holdout"`.
  Fast (~25s). Run before every commit; expect 0 failures. (Sizes drift —
  `pytest --collect-only -q` reports the current count rather than a number baked in here.)
- **Everything non-clinical:** `make test-all`
  (`pytest tests/ -m "not clinical and not holdout"`).
- **Coverage:** `make test-cov`.
- **Clinical / LLM-as-judge gate:** `make test-clinical` (`pytest tests/ -m clinical` —
  the marker is the selector, and `tests/test_level5_flow.py` carries it too).
  Makes real Claude calls (**~11 min** — the full target measured 18m33s on 2026-07-28
  including the held-out report, which was 7m25s of it and has since moved to its own
  marker); requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the shell env — source it from the gitignored
  `.env`, never hardcode or print it. This is the golden-set accuracy gate (incl.
  GC-018/019); run it at the final merge HEAD for any behavior change. Runs with `-s`:
  the accuracy figures are printed, and pytest captures stdout on passing tests, so
  without it the target discards the numbers it exists to produce.
- **Held-out (out-of-sample) report:** `make test-holdout` (`pytest tests/ -m holdout`).
  ~7.5 min of live calls over the 32-case declared holdout. **Not a gate** — its only
  assertion is a wiring check. First reading 2026-07-28: **87.5% (28/32)**, Wilson 95%
  CI 71.9–95.0%, zero score-1. Not directly comparable to the golden-set figure: that
  set includes 5 pre-flight cases decided deterministically with no model call, this
  one has none.

> **`holdout` is a separate marker from `clinical` on purpose, and the reason is not

> (or `--all`) validates a change manifest against `change_manifest.schema.json` plus the
> `GC-\d{3}` case-id convention; exit 0 = valid, 1 = errors (per-error report on stderr).
> CI runs it on every PR as the `validate-manifests` job (P-6).

## Limitations (what the design intends but the code does not yet do)

- **No middleware layer** and **no `agent.yaml` loader** — agents are wired by direct
  Python import. The seven-component per-agent harness layout is roadmap. The P-4
  scope guard (`agents/scope_guard.py`) is the first middleware-*pattern* component — a
  call-site wrapper, not a framework middleware — now wired into the submit route in
  enforce mode (chg-9). A true middleware loader remains roadmap.
- **Precedent grounding (P-5 policy, iter-13).** Retrieved precedents are institutional
  *context*, not citable evidence: the DecisionAgent still populates
  `cited_evidence_ids` from **submission** `EvidenceItem`s only, so the P-5
  evidence-grounding detector stays submission-scoped. A precedent influences reasoning
  (and is captured in the rationale + the retrieved-context audit), but is not a
  grounded-evidence id. Threading stable precedent/chunk ids into the grounding set is
  the roadmap "RAG chunk-id grounding" follow-up.
- **CI gates are blocking on the PR path only (admin push bypasses them).** P-6 is
  otherwise complete: `validate-manifests` (every PR) and `clinical-gate` (GC-018/019 +
  accuracy) run, the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret is set, and both are required status
  checks on `main`. The residual gap is `enforce_admins: false` with no required review —
  an admin pushing directly to `main` lands unreviewed, ungated commits, which is how the
  2026-07-29 118-commit backlog merged. Closing it means enabling "Include administrators"
  (David's step) and accepting that emergency direct pushes then require a temporary
  disable. Doc-drift already runs inside `tests/unit` (P-1).
- **Medical Director case resolution is unimplemented.** The review queue
  (`GET /authorizations/review-queue`) reads real escalated decisions, and `/feedback`
  writes a real precedent, but nothing records a director's *disposition*: no
  `HumanReviewModel` row, no decision-outcome change. A reviewed case reappears on the
  next fetch. The API says so in `ReviewQueueResponse.resolution_supported` (False) and
  the UI renders that flag rather than a constant of its own — so this stays honest by
  construction. Implementing resolution means a disposition write plus flipping the flag.
- **Policy change log is in-memory.** See the safety-invariants note above.

## Target architecture (roadmap)

These are the intended end-states, moved here so they are not mistaken for current fact:

- **Seven-component per-agent layout** (NexAU-style): each agent as
  `system_prompt.md` + `long_term_memory.md` + `tool_descriptions/*.tool.yaml` +
  `tools/*.py` + `middleware/*.py` + `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` +
  `sub_agents/<name>/agent.yaml`, declared in a per-agent `agent.yaml` loaded by a
  framework. Rationale: file-level component decoupling + one-file-diff rollback.
- **RAG chunk-id grounding (P-5 follow-up):** thread stable chunk ids from
  `retrieve_relevant_guidelines` through into the agent-visible context and expose the
  retrieved-id set to the orchestrator, so the P-5 evidence-grounding detector
  (`agents/evidence_grounding.py`) can also verify citations against *retrieved RAG
  chunks*. Today the retriever hands the agent concatenated text with no ids, so P-5
  grounds only against submission `EvidenceItem` ids.
- **CI enforcement (P-6): done, minus the admin bypass.** The jobs exist, run, and are
  required status checks on `main` (verified 2026-07-29). What remains is
  `enforce_admins` — see Limitations.
- **Integration test tier:** `tests/integration/` holds 2 real-Postgres tests
  (`test_submit_postgres.py`, marked `postgres`), which skip unless `POSTGRES_TEST_URL`
  is set — `make test-postgres`. The intent is wider end-to-end coverage across real
  component boundaries (API → orchestrator → scope guard → repository → audit log)
  rather than the unit tier's mocked seams.

Test-tier sizes as of 2026-07-25 (`pytest --collect-only -q` is authoritative;
these drift): `tests/unit` 724, `tests/clinical` 28, `tests/harness` 27,
`tests/integration` 2, `tests/test_level5_flow.py` 3 — 784 total, of which 8 carry
the `clinical` marker. `pytest tests/ -m "not clinical"` = 774 passed, 2 skipped.

The frontend has its own tier: `frontend/e2e/` (Playwright, backend mocked by route
interception) — `cd frontend && npx playwright test`. Not part of `make test-all`.

## Canonical repo

`github.com/drdgreed/pacca` is canonical. If you find `Chaos-6/pacca` anywhere
(old clone URLs, citation), it is stale — update it to `drdgreed`.

## House style

- Async throughout the backend. Don't introduce blocking calls in request paths.
- Pydantic v2 models for all request/response and domain objects.
- Keep retrieval (rag), reasoning (agents), and safety (orchestrator) separable —
  a change to one should not force edits to the others.
- Logging: `from pacca.config import get_logger` (structlog-backed) — never
  `logging.getLogger` (see `docs/AGENT_LESSONS.md` P-002).
