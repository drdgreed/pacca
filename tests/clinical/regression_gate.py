"""
Per-case regression gate for the PACCA clinical golden dataset — iter-2.

WHY THIS EXISTS (read this first)
---------------------------------
The existing CI gate in `evaluator.py` works like this:
  - A case "passes" if the judge scores it >= 3 (MINIMUM_PASSING_SCORE).
  - The whole run passes if >= 80% of cases pass (MINIMUM_ACCEPTABLE_ACCURACY).

That gate is AGGREGATE and ABSOLUTE. It has one blind spot that matters a great
deal for the v2.3 harness cycle: a case can slide from a 5 ("excellent, complete
reasoning") down to a 3 ("acceptable, vague reasoning") and STILL count as a pass,
because 3 >= 3. The aggregate stays green and nobody is alerted.

That 5 -> 3 slide — correct decision, hollowed-out reasoning — is exactly the
failure mode an over-aggressive institutional-memory entry (Phase H2) is most
likely to produce. The current net cannot see it.

This module closes that blind spot. It records each case's score at a known-good
baseline (e.g. harness-iter-1) and then, on every later run, flags any case whose
score DROPS relative to its own baseline — even when the aggregate is still above
80%. It is a *relative* gate that complements the existing *absolute* gate; it
does not replace it.

DESIGN NOTE — why stdlib only
-----------------------------
The regression gate reasons about integer scores keyed by case_id. It does not
need the Anthropic SDK, the agents, or anything else. Keeping it dependency-free
means the gate can run in any CI job (even one without an API key) and is trivial
to unit-test with synthetic scores. It accepts plain dicts {case_id: score} and
also offers an adapter for the `JudgeVerdict` objects produced by `evaluator.py`,
using duck typing so it never has to import that module.
