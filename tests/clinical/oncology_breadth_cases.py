Oncology breadth cases — 300-milestone Batch M (prevalence-weighted), pass 1.

WHY THESE EXIST
---------------
The iter-6 `oncology_depth_cases.py` (GC-083–088) covered six cancer
types as gap-closure: multiple myeloma, ovarian, head/neck, melanoma,
prostate, HCC. The 300-case milestone is *prevalence-weighted* (mirrors
a commercial-payer claim mix) rather than gap-closure, so this file adds
the high-incidence cancer types not yet represented at depth, with a
deliberate spread of outcomes to keep the eval honest.

  GC-101  Metastatic colorectal — FOLFIRI + bevacizumab        AUTO_APPROVED
  GC-102  HR+/HER2- metastatic breast — ribociclib + letrozole AUTO_APPROVED
  GC-103  Metastatic pancreatic 2nd-line, ECOG 3               IN_REVIEW
  GC-104  Metastatic clear-cell RCC — pembrolizumab + axitinib AUTO_APPROVED
  GC-105  Metastatic urothelial — EV monotherapy, wrong line   DENIED

Outcome spread: 3 AUTO_APPROVED, 1 IN_REVIEW, 1 DENIED. The two
non-approve cases probe distinct failure modes:
  - GC-103: an approved drug whose appropriateness is questionable for
    THIS patient (ECOG 3 — excluded from the registration trials;
    NCCN recommends best supportive care at this performance status).
    Tests that the system separates "is the drug guideline-listed" from
    "is it appropriate for this patient."
  - GC-105: the right drug at the wrong line. Enfortumab vedotin
    monotherapy is a later-line option; requesting it first-line in a
    treatment-naïve, cisplatin-eligible patient is a sequencing error.
    Tests step/sequence logic, not on/off-formulary.

GC-101 deliberately differs from GC-034 (off-label pancreatic nivolumab,
DENIED): there the drug had no compendia support; here every drug is
guideline-listed and the discriminator is patient-fit (GC-103) or
line-of-therapy (GC-105).
