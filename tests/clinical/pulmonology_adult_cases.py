"""
Adult pulmonology cases — iter-6 Batch E (adult pulm depth to 5).

WHY THESE EXIST
---------------
At iter-5 close, adult pulmonology had ZERO cases (GC-012 was the only
pulm case and it was pediatric). This file adds 5 cases to establish
within-specialty signal across adult asthma biologics, COPD escalation,
pulmonary rehab, sleep medicine, and biologic-class discrimination.

  GC-050  Adult severe eosinophilic asthma dupilumab    AUTO_APPROVED
  GC-051  COPD triple therapy after exacerbation        AUTO_APPROVED
  GC-052  Pulmonary rehab post-exacerbation             AUTO_APPROVED
  GC-053  CPAP initiation post-AASM sleep study         AUTO_APPROVED
  GC-054  Adult severe asthma mepolizumab (anti-IL-5)   AUTO_APPROVED

GC-050 vs GC-054 — both adult severe asthma biologics, different molecular
classes (anti-IL-4Rα vs anti-IL-5). Tests that the agent recognizes both
classes' criteria correctly and does not mis-apply class-specific rules.
