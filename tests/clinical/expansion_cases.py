Expansion cases — iter-6 gap-closure suite.

WHY THESE EXIST
---------------
The 25-case dataset at iter-5 close covered the seven escalation branches and
the H2 memory-trap surface, but `EVALUATION_COVERAGE.md` identified several
dimensions with zero or near-zero coverage:

  - **Outcome distribution.** Zero DENY-class cases. The per-case gate cannot
    detect a regression on a "criteria explicitly unmet" disposition if no such
    case exists.
  - **Specialty coverage.** No cardiology, nephrology, psychiatry/behavioral,
    neurology (beyond a trivial reference), or OB/fertility cases.
  - **Age stratification.** No cases for patients aged ≥ 75 (geriatric
    complexity).

This file adds 8 hand-crafted cases to close the highest-priority gaps from
that list. The cases are intentionally diverse across specialty and disposition
so each one closes a distinct dimension rather than redundantly probing the
same surface.

  GC-026  DENY      Oncology / Radiation     Proton-beam for low-risk prostate
  GC-027  DENY      Cardiology               Cath without prior non-invasive workup
  GC-028  AUTO_APP  Cardiology (geriatric)   ICD implant per CMS NCD criteria
  GC-029  IN_REVIEW Psychiatry / Behavioral  Adult ADHD stimulant w/ concurrent SUD
  GC-030  AUTO_APP  Hematology (sickle cell) Hydroxyurea per NHLBI/ASH criteria
  GC-031  AUTO_APP  Nephrology / Transplant  Tacrolimus maintenance post-transplant
  GC-032  AUTO_APP  Neurology / Headache     CGRP after documented preventive failures
  GC-033  AUTO_APP  Reproductive endocrine   Fertility preservation pre-chemo

HOW TO USE
----------
EXPANSION_CASES is kept as a separate list from GOLDEN_CASES (mirroring the
iter-2 chg-3 NEAR_MISS_CASES + iter-5 chg-2 PEDIATRIC_CASES precedents) so:

  - GOLDEN_CASES stays at 20 and test_dataset_has_twenty_cases still passes
  - The cases run through the same evaluator + judge as the canonical suite
  - When a specialty here grows past 5 cases, the next contributor splits it
    into a thematic file (denial_cases.py, cardiology_cases.py, etc.) per
    `docs/CASE_AUTHORING_GUIDE.md` § 9

LIMITATION ACKNOWLEDGED
-----------------------
`capture_baseline.py` currently only iterates GOLDEN_CASES, not the
supplementary lists (NEAR_MISS_CASES, PEDIATRIC_CASES, EXPANSION_CASES). The
expansion cases here therefore run through `test_clinical_accuracy.py`'s full
pipeline but are not part of the captured-baseline regression gate. The right
fix is to teach `capture_baseline.py` to aggregate all four lists; that work
is scoped to iter-6 (separate PR) rather than mixed into this dataset-growth
work.
