Golden dataset for PACCA clinical evaluation — Week 4.

This module defines 20 hand-crafted clinical cases with known-correct
outcomes. Each case is annotated with:
  - expected_outcome: what the system SHOULD decide
  - expected_routing: which escalation path should trigger
  - reasoning_must_include: keywords that must appear in the rationale
  - reasoning_must_not_include: hallucination markers to check for
  - clinical_rationale: the human expert reasoning for this case

These cases cover all 7 escalation branches plus boundary conditions.
They are the ground truth against which the LLM-as-judge evaluates
agent reasoning quality.

Teaching note — why hand-crafted cases over auto-generated ones?

  Auto-generated test data is fast but shallow. For clinical AI, the
  cases that matter most are the HARD ones — the ones where a wrong
  answer has patient consequences. Those cases require clinical domain
  knowledge to construct correctly. A synthetically generated case might
  have internally consistent data but miss the clinical nuance that makes
  a case actually challenging.

  These 20 cases were designed to probe specific failure modes:
    - Will the agent correctly identify a contraindication?
    - Will it recognize that 'clinical trial' language means experimental?
    - Will it apply step therapy requirements correctly?
    - Will it avoid hallucinating lab values not present in the notes?

  Each case is a specific clinical claim. Together they form a minimum
  viable evaluation suite for a prior authorization system.
