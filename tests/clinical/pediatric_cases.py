Pediatric golden cases — iter-5 chg-2 (data prerequisite for chg-3
complexity-score model).

WHY THESE EXIST
---------------
Before iter-5, the entire 22-case dataset (20 GOLDEN + 2 NEAR_MISS) contained
exactly ONE pediatric case: GC-012 (14-year-old with severe persistent asthma,
expected outcome IN_REVIEW). One data point can defend a keyword heuristic
("if pediatric AND severity language matches 'severe' / 'moderate-to-severe'
/ 'complex' / 'critical' → escalate") but cannot found a score-based
discriminator. A complexity score model needs contrastive examples on both
sides of its threshold.

iter-5 chg-2 adds three pediatric cases that, together with GC-012, give the
chg-3 score model four data points across the discriminator's input space:

  GC-012  14yo  severe asthma         IN_REVIEW   (existing)
  GC-023  10yo  mild well-controlled  AUTO_APPROVED   (new — below threshold)
  GC-024  16yo  moderate Crohn's,     IN_REVIEW   (new — ambiguous; multiple
                  1 immunomodulator                    weights push it over
                  failure                              the threshold)
  GC-025   9yo  severe AD,            IN_REVIEW   (new — high score in a
                  failed topicals +                    different disease,
                  cyclosporine                         confirms model
                                                       generalizes)

PEDIATRIC_CASES is kept as a separate list from GOLDEN_CASES (mirroring the
iter-2 chg-3 NEAR_MISS_CASES precedent) so:
  - GOLDEN_CASES stays at 20 and test_dataset_has_twenty_cases still passes
  - The cases run as a discrete "pediatric discrimination suite" through
    the clinical-gate loop
  - The chg-3 complexity-score model has a named set to validate against
