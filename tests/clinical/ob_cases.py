OB / reproductive / pregnancy cases — iter-6 Batch J (OB depth to 6).

WHY THESE EXIST
---------------
At iter-5 close, OB / female-specific care had ZERO cases. Iter-6
expansion_cases added GC-033 (fertility preservation pre-chemo
AUTO_APPROVED). This file adds 5 more to reach 6 — coverage across
routine prenatal, prenatal screening, postpartum, gestational complications,
and contraception/sterilization with Medicaid-specific rules.
