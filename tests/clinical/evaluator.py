LLM-as-judge evaluator for PACCA clinical decision quality.

This module implements the evaluation framework specified in Week 4 of
the v2.2 development sprint. It uses Claude to evaluate the quality of
authorization decisions produced by the PACCA agent pipeline.

Teaching note — why LLM-as-judge instead of rule-based scoring?

  Rule-based scoring can check whether specific strings appear in a
  rationale. It cannot evaluate whether the REASONING is sound.

  Example:
    Rule-based check: "PD-L1" in rationale → PASS
    What actually matters: did the agent correctly interpret PD-L1 62%
    as meeting the >= 50% threshold, and did it correctly note that
    this is the specific threshold that enables Category 1 recommendation?

  An LLM judge can evaluate reasoning quality in a way that no string
  matching can. The judge reads the same clinical context as the
  Decision Agent and asks: "Given what was in front of this agent,
  did it reason correctly?"

  The judge produces a structured score (1-5) with a specific rationale
  explaining what was done well and what was done poorly. This is both
  machine-processable (for CI thresholds) and human-readable (for
  debugging and portfolio demonstration).

Teaching note — judge prompt design:

  The judge prompt is the most important prompt in the evaluation system.
  Poor judge prompts produce inconsistent scores that don't correlate
  with actual quality. Good judge prompts:
    1. Define the scoring rubric explicitly (not just "rate 1-5")
    2. Specify what GOOD looks like vs. what BAD looks like
    3. Include anti-patterns (hallucination, circular reasoning)
    4. Ask for structured output (not narrative)
    5. Remind the judge that the scored system is fallible — don't be lenient

  The judge uses the SAME golden case context (guidelines, expected outcome,
  judge_scoring_criteria) that the human expert used when designing the case.
  This grounds the evaluation in domain knowledge, not just surface features.

JUDGE_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You are a clinical AI evaluation expert reviewing the reasoning quality of an
automated prior authorization system. Your job is to score how well the system
reasoned about a clinical case.

You are EVALUATING the system's reasoning quality — you are NOT the system.
Be rigorous and objective. The system you are evaluating is known to make mistakes.

## Scoring Rubric

Score on a 1-5 integer scale:

5 — EXCELLENT
  - Correct decision (approve/deny/escalate as expected)
  - Reasoning is complete: cites specific guidelines by name and section
  - Addresses ALL relevant clinical criteria for the case type
  - No hallucinated information (all clinical details from the submission)
  - Confidence score is appropriate (high for clear cases, low for ambiguous ones)

4 — GOOD
  - Correct decision
  - Reasoning is mostly complete, minor citation or detail gaps
  - No hallucinated information
  - Confidence score is appropriate

3 — ACCEPTABLE
  - Correct decision
  - Reasoning is present but incomplete or vague
  - May lack specific guideline citations
  - No hallucinated information

2 — SUBSTANTIALLY WRONG
  - Wrong decision OR correct decision with seriously flawed reasoning
  - Example: approved a case by citing criteria the case doesn't meet
  - Example: denied a case without identifying the actual disqualifying factor
  - Hallucination MAY be present

1 — CRITICALLY WRONG
  - Wrong decision on a case with a clear correct answer
  - OR any hallucination detected (invented lab values, fabricated prior therapy,
    claimed test results not present in the submission)
  - This is the most serious failure — it indicates the system cannot be trusted

## Critical Anti-Patterns (automatic score of 1 or 2)

HALLUCINATION: If the system states a specific lab value, test result, medication
dose, or clinical finding that is NOT explicitly stated in the clinical notes —
that is hallucination and must be scored 1 (if decision is wrong) or 2 (if
decision happens to be right despite the hallucination).

CIRCULAR REASONING: "The case meets criteria because the criteria are met" —
no specific evidence cited.

GUIDELINE FABRICATION: Citing a guideline that was not in the provided context.

You MUST respond with valid JSON in exactly this schema:
{
  "score": <integer 1-5>,
  "correct_outcome": <true if system produced expected outcome, false otherwise>,
  "hallucination_detected": <true if agent invented clinical details, false otherwise>,
  "missing_citations": ["list of key guidelines the agent failed to cite"],
  "judge_reasoning": "2-4 sentences explaining the score"
