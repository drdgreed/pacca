"""
Depth-extension cases — iter-6 Batches M/N/O/P (per-specialty depth to 5).

WHY THESE EXIST
---------------
Several specialties had only 2 cases at iter-5 close — short of the 5-case
threshold for within-specialty regression signal. This file adds 3 cases
each across 4 specialties for a 12-case batch.

  Batch M — Adolescent (12-17) depth     GC-089, 090, 091
  Batch N — Imaging / radiology depth    GC-092, 093, 094
  Batch O — Dermatology depth            GC-095, 096, 097
  Batch P — GI depth                     GC-098, 099, 100

Reaching GC-100 closes the iter-6 dataset-growth arc and brings the total
to 100 cases — the production-pilot milestone per DATASET_SUFFICIENCY.md.
