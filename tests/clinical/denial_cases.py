Denial-class cases — iter-6 Batch A (DENY expansion to 5).

WHY THESE EXIST
---------------
At iter-5 close, the dataset had ZERO DENY-class cases. Iter-6 expansion_cases
added GC-026 (proton-beam for low-risk prostate per NCCN/ASTRO) and GC-027
(cath without non-invasive workup per ACC/AHA). This file adds 3 more to
reach 5 — the minimum sample size for a defensible "we test denials" claim
per DATASET_SUFFICIENCY.md § "Recommended priority order".

The 3 cases probe the 3 most common production-deny categories beyond
patient-preference (GC-026) and workup-hierarchy (GC-027):

  GC-034  Off-label use without NCCN compendia support      DENIED
  GC-035  Frequency-cap violation (PT visits over benefit)  DENIED
  GC-036  Re-request after prior denial without new evidence DENIED

Per CASE_AUTHORING_GUIDE.md § 9 — at ≥ 5 cases, a category warrants its own
file. DENY now has its own file.
