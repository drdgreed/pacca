"""
Provenance of ``decision_id`` — regression tests for PRODUCTION_READINESS B6.

The bug: ``DecisionAgent.run()`` passed ``response_model=AuthorizationDecision``,
so the model's forced tool-use output *was* the decision object — ``decision_id``
included. That value was persisted into a ``unique=True`` column, which meant:

  * resubmitting the same case produced the same id and 500'd on an IntegrityError
  * the id format was whatever the model felt like emitting that run
  * ``audit_logs.decision_id`` and the ``human_reviews`` FK both point at this
    value, so a reused id silently cross-links two decisions' audit trails

The invariant these tests protect is deliberately broader than the crash:

    No LLM-supplied value may land in a unique, indexed, or foreign-keyed column.

Teaching note — why assert on the *schema* and not just the outcome:

  Asserting "two runs produce different ids" would pass if someone re-introduced
  a model-supplied id that merely happened to vary. Asserting that ``decision_id``
  is absent from the tool schema pins the actual contract: the model is never
  asked for an identifier in the first place. Both tests are here because they
  fail for different reasons.
