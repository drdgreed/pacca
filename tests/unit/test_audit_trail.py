"""
Unit tests for audit trail wiring — Week 1 implementation.

These tests verify that:
  1. Every authorization submission produces at least one audit record
  2. Every successful decision produces a decision audit record
  3. Failures produce failure audit records (not silence)
  4. The feedback/learning endpoint produces a precedent_learned record
  5. All audit records for one request share the same correlation_id

Teaching note — why test audit logging specifically?
  Audit logging is invisible to end users and easy to accidentally break.
  Without tests, a refactor could silently disable audit writes and you
  would not know until a compliance audit revealed missing records.
  These tests make audit behavior a first-class, enforced contract.

Teaching note — what is a mock?
  The AI agents (DecisionAgent, MedicalDirectorAgent) make real HTTP calls
  to the Anthropic API. In tests, we never want to make real API calls —
  they are slow, cost money, and may fail due to network issues.
  A "mock" is a fake object that pretends to be the real thing.
  unittest.mock.AsyncMock creates a fake async function that returns
  whatever you tell it to return, instantly, with no network call.
  This lets us test the audit wiring independently of the AI responses.
