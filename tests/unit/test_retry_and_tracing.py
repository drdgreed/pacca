"""
Tests for LLM retry logic and OpenTelemetry instrumentation — Week 3.

These tests verify:
  1. Retriable errors (429, 5xx, connection errors) are retried
  2. Non-retriable errors (400, 401, ValueError) are NOT retried
  3. After max_attempts, the last error is re-raised
  4. OTel spans are created for every agent call
  5. Span attributes (agent name, model, tokens, duration) are recorded
  6. Span errors are recorded when the LLM call fails

Teaching note — what we're testing here vs. what we're NOT testing:

  We ARE testing the retry and tracing WIRING — the mechanism that decides
  when to retry and whether spans are opened/closed correctly.

  We are NOT testing the Anthropic API itself — we mock it completely.
  We are NOT testing whether the retry waits the right number of seconds —
  that would make tests take 30+ seconds. We verify retry COUNT, not timing.

  The golden rule of unit tests: test the behavior of YOUR code, not the
  behavior of libraries you depend on. tenacity's backoff math is tenacity's
  problem to test. Your problem is: does your code call tenacity correctly?

Teaching note — how to test retry logic without waiting:

  tenacity's wait parameter controls how long to sleep between attempts.
  In tests, we don't want to sleep. We use tenacity's testing utilities to
  override the wait strategy with wait_none() — zero wait between retries.
  This lets us test "did it retry 3 times?" in milliseconds, not seconds.
