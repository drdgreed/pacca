This guide describes the template, the workflow, and the review gates for adding a new clinical evaluation case to PACCA. A case that follows this guide will:

- compile cleanly against the existing `GoldenCase` schema,
- carry the provenance metadata required by [`CASE_PROVENANCE.md`](./CASE_PROVENANCE.md),
- be defensible to a HIPAA / SaMD reviewer asking "why does this case exist?",
- contain zero PHI and cite an authoritative clinical guideline,
- run through the regression-gate and judge-scoring pipeline without special handling.

## 1. Before you write — decide WHY this case exists

A new case must answer one of two questions:

| Question | What kind of case satisfies it |
|---|---|
| **Coverage gap** — "we have no case that probes [X]" | A clean positive or negative case for a gate, branch, demographic, or specialty that is currently under-represented. See `EVALUATION_COVERAGE.md` for the current gap map. |
| **Adversarial probe** — "we want to verify the agent will not [Y]" | A failure-mode case (hallucination trap, memory trap, step-therapy bypass, anti-pattern routing). See the failure-mode taxonomy in `CASE_PROVENANCE.md`. |

If you cannot state in one sentence which gap or failure mode this case probes, **do not add it.** Speculative cases dilute the suite without buying detection.

The recommended priority order — which gap to close next — is in [`DATASET_SUFFICIENCY.md` § "Recommended priority order"](./DATASET_SUFFICIENCY.md).

## 2. The schema

A case is an instance of the `GoldenCase` dataclass defined in [`tests/clinical/golden_cases.py`](../tests/clinical/golden_cases.py). All required fields:

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `case_id` | `str` | `GC-NNN`. Monotonically increasing across the entire dataset (GOLDEN + NEAR_MISS + PEDIATRIC + future siblings). |
| `title` | `str` | One human-readable line for test output (≤ 100 chars). |
| `diagnosis_code` | `str` | ICD-10. |
| `diagnosis_description` | `str` | Plain text matching the ICD-10. |
| `procedure_code` | `str` | CPT, HCPCS, or J-code. |
| `procedure_description` | `str` | Brand name in parens after generic. |
| `clinical_notes` | `str` | The synthetic provider notes the agent will read. 3–8 sentences. PHI-free. See § 4. |
| `guidelines_context` | `str` | The synthetic RAG payload — what guidelines retrieval would return for this diagnosis × procedure. 2–5 sentences. Cite real guideline body. |
| `expected_outcome` | `ExpectedOutcome` | `AUTO_APPROVED`, `IN_REVIEW`, `DENIED`, or `PRE_FLIGHT_ESCALATE`. |
| `expected_branch` | `EscalationBranch` | Which SS5.4 branch should fire (1–7 or NONE). |
| `reasoning_must_include` | `list[str]` | Substrings that MUST appear in the agent's rationale. 1–4 phrases, lowercase. |
| `reasoning_must_not_include` | `list[str]` | Hallucination markers. The most powerful test surface — include words the agent must not invent (e.g., a lab value never mentioned in the notes). |
| `prior_denial_codes` | `list[str]` | Empty unless this is a branch_7 case. |
| `clinical_rationale` | `str` | 2–5 sentence human-expert justification for the expected outcome. This is what an SME would write. |
| `judge_scoring_criteria` | `str` | What the LLM-as-judge should explicitly evaluate. Anchors the rubric. |

## 3. The template

Copy this block and edit. Comments mark what to change.

```python
GoldenCase(
    case_id="GC-NNN",  # Next monotonically-increasing ID. See git for the latest.
    title="<specialty> <condition> — <one-line clinical hook>",
    diagnosis_code="<ICD-10>",
    diagnosis_description="<plain text matching the ICD-10>",
    procedure_code="<CPT/HCPCS/J-code>",
    procedure_description="<Generic name (Brand name)>",
    clinical_notes=(
        # 3–8 sentences. Include:
        #   - age, sex, relevant demographics
        #   - severity / staging language
        #   - prior therapies (with duration, response)
        #   - relevant labs / imaging (only if the case is testing
        #     that the agent uses them — don't add unused data)
        #   - the requesting provider's stated rationale
        # PHI-free. Never invent: SSN, MRN, DOB, full name, address.
        "<3–8 sentences of synthetic provider notes>"
    ),
    guidelines_context=(
        # 2–5 sentences. What the RAG layer would return.
        # MUST cite a real guideline body (NCCN, ACR, AAD, GINA, ECCO, etc.)
        # Do not invent guideline content. Paraphrase real guidance.
        "<2–5 sentences of synthetic RAG payload>"
    ),
    expected_outcome=ExpectedOutcome.<...>,
    expected_branch=EscalationBranch.<...>,
    reasoning_must_include=["<phrase 1>", "<phrase 2>"],
    reasoning_must_not_include=["<hallucination marker>"],
    clinical_rationale=(
        "<2–5 sentence human-expert justification>"
    ),
    judge_scoring_criteria=(
        "<what the LLM-as-judge should evaluate>"
    ),
),
```

## 4. The PHI rule (non-negotiable)

`clinical_notes` is the field most likely to leak protected information. Follow these rules strictly:

| Allowed | Forbidden |
|---|---|
| `"58-year-old male"` | `"John Smith, DOB 5/4/1967"` |
| `"PD-L1 expression 62%"` | `"PD-L1 results from LabCorp report dated 3/12/2024"` |
| `"NCCN Category 1"` | `"per Dr. Jane Doe's note 4/15/2024"` |
| `"BMI 28"` | `"weight 187 lb, height 5'10''"` (re-identification risk in small populations) |
| `"history of T2DM and HTN"` | `"patient lives at 123 Main St, retired teacher"` |

The PACCA repo's CLAUDE.md is explicit: **"Never put real PHI in fixtures, seeds, or committed files. Synthetic data only."** This applies to authored cases.

If a case is derived from a real patient encounter (e.g., an SME drafting from memory of a clinical experience), the author MUST:

1. Change age by ±3 years and sex if doing so does not invalidate the clinical signal.
2. Re-randomize labs to within ±15% of the original.
3. Remove all dates, locations, and proper nouns except the institution-class ("a pediatric gastroenterologist", not "the pediatric gastroenterologist at Boston Children's").
4. State in the PR description: "derived from clinical experience; PHI removed per CASE_AUTHORING_GUIDE.md § 4."

## 5. The guideline-citation rule

`guidelines_context` MUST cite a real authoritative body. The recognized bodies for PACCA's specialty mix:

| Specialty | Recognized guideline bodies |
|---|---|
| Oncology | NCCN, ASCO, ESMO, CMS NCD |
| Rheumatology | ACR, EULAR |
| Gastroenterology | ACG, AGA, ECCO, ESPGHAN (pediatric) |
| Dermatology | AAD, AAD-NPF (psoriasis), EADV |
| Pulmonology | ATS, ERS, GINA (asthma), GOLD (COPD) |
| Cardiology | ACC/AHA, ESC, HRS (electrophysiology) |
| Endocrinology | ADA, AACE, ATA (thyroid) |
| Neurology | AAN, AHA/ASA (stroke), MS Society |
| Surgery / Orthopedics | AAOS, NASS (spine), ACS |
| Imaging | ACR Appropriateness Criteria, AUC |
| Pediatrics | AAP, plus specialty-specific (e.g., ESPGHAN for peds GI) |

If your case touches a specialty not listed, add the recognized body to this table in the same PR.

**Do not invent guideline content.** If you are not certain what NCCN actually says about (e.g.) third-line therapy for relapsed multiple myeloma, find the published guideline and paraphrase the relevant section — do not write what you assume it says. The judge will score against the cited body; a hallucinated citation propagates into evaluation correctness.

## 6. Choosing `reasoning_must_not_include`

This is the most powerful field in the schema, and the most under-used. It exists to catch hallucinations.

**The rule:** include phrases that the agent would only produce if it invented data.

Examples from the existing dataset:

- GC-018 (sparse-notes case): `reasoning_must_not_include = ["HbA1c", "creatinine"]` — these labs were not in the notes; if the agent's rationale mentions them, it hallucinated.
- GC-019 (sparse-notes case): `reasoning_must_not_include = ["prior therapy with"]` — no prior therapy was documented; if the agent invents one, this fires.
- GC-021 (memory-trap case): `reasoning_must_not_include = ["NSCLC + pembrolizumab is always approved"]` — H2 memory compression failure mode.

When authoring, ask: **"what is the most plausible thing a hallucinating agent would say that would still sound competent?"** Add that phrase here.

If you cannot think of one, the case may be a routine coverage case (which is fine) — leave `reasoning_must_not_include = []`.

## 7. Choosing `expected_outcome` and `expected_branch`

The branch matters because the per-case regression gate compares both outcome and branch. A case that flips from `BRANCH_1_AUTO_APPROVE` to `BRANCH_2_MEDICAL_DIRECTOR` is a regression even if both produce `AUTO_APPROVED` in the end.

Decision tree:

```
Is the case experimental (CAR-T, phase-N trial, off-label)?
  → expected_branch = BRANCH_4_EXPERIMENTAL

Is the diagnosis ICD-10 in the rare-disease prefix list?
  → expected_branch = BRANCH_5_RARE

Does the case re-request after a prior denial?
  → expected_branch = BRANCH_7_PRIOR_DENIAL

Do the cited guidelines conflict (e.g., NCCN says yes, CMS NCD says no)?
  → expected_branch = BRANCH_6_CONFLICTING

Is the documentation incomplete or evidence borderline?
  → expected_outcome = IN_REVIEW
  → expected_branch = BRANCH_3_LOW_CONFIDENCE

Does the case trigger a policy escalation (high-cost > $100K, pediatric+complex,
  oncology+experimental adjunct)?
  → expected_outcome = IN_REVIEW
  → expected_branch = BRANCH_2_MEDICAL_DIRECTOR

Otherwise — clean documentation, all criteria met, no escalation triggers:
  → expected_outcome = AUTO_APPROVED
  → expected_branch = BRANCH_1_AUTO_APPROVE

Documentation present but criteria explicitly unmet (e.g., guideline requires X,
  case has not-X):
  → expected_outcome = DENIED
  → expected_branch = NONE  (denial is not an escalation)
```

## 8. Naming and ID-allocation discipline

`case_id` is `GC-NNN`. Rules:

- IDs are monotonic across **all** case files. The highest ID in the dataset is the next-1; you start at next.
- IDs are never reused. If a case is removed, its ID is retired (state this in the commit message).
- Adding a case across multiple files in one PR: allocate IDs sequentially in the order they appear in the PR diff.

To find the highest ID, run:

```bash
grep -rh 'case_id="GC-' tests/clinical/ | sed 's/.*GC-\([0-9]*\)".*/\1/' | sort -n | tail -1
```

## 9. Where the case goes — file selection

| Case kind | File | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Clean adult positive/negative or branch-N positive | `tests/clinical/golden_cases.py` (in `GOLDEN_CASES`) | Default. The 20-case canonical suite. |
| Adversarial near-miss (one-disqualifier-off-from-a-known-approve) | `tests/clinical/near_miss_cases.py` (in `NEAR_MISS_CASES`) | Iter-2 chg-3 precedent: kept separate so `GOLDEN_CASES` length is stable and the gate has a named adversarial suite. |
| Pediatric case feeding the complexity-score discriminator | `tests/clinical/pediatric_cases.py` (in `PEDIATRIC_CASES`) | Iter-5 chg-2 precedent: a named contrastive set with a specific model-validation purpose. |
| A new category that doesn't fit the above (e.g., 8+ DENY-class cases warranting a `denial_cases.py`) | New file, new list, mirror the existing pattern | Create the sibling file when the new category has ≥ 5 cases and a coherent purpose. |

If you are adding < 5 cases of a new "category," put them in `GOLDEN_CASES`. Create a new file only when the category earns its own collective name.

## 10. Wire-up checklist (mechanical)

When a new case lands, the following sites must be updated:

| Site | What to add |
|---|---|
| `tests/clinical/<file>.py` | The new `GoldenCase(...)` entry. |
| `tests/clinical/test_clinical_accuracy.py` | If you added a new case file, register it in the test fixture aggregating all cases. |
| `tests/clinical/baselines/<latest>.json` | After first capture run, the baseline scoreboard will include the new case. Commit the baseline update with the case. |
| `docs/CASE_PROVENANCE.md` | Add one row per the schema in that file. **Required.** |
| `docs/EVALUATION_COVERAGE.md` | Update the relevant dimension matrices. **Required.** |
| `docs/DATASET_SUFFICIENCY.md` | Update the case count in § "Where we are" if the new total crosses a threshold (50, 100, 300, 500). |
| Iteration manifest (`docs/iterations/iter-N.json`) | If the case lands in the current iteration, add it under the change's `risk_cases` or as a `chg-N` of its own. |
| `docs/HARNESS.md` § evaluation section | Update the case-count reference if it cites a specific number. |

## 11. The SME review gate (Phase 1 — pre-merge, in-house)

Before merging a case, the author must obtain SME concurrence on:

1. **Clinical accuracy of `clinical_notes`** — would a board-certified specialist in the relevant field find this scenario plausible?
2. **Guideline citation in `guidelines_context`** — does the cited body actually say what the field paraphrases?
3. **Correctness of `expected_outcome` and `expected_branch`** — given the notes + guideline, would the specialist agree this is the right disposition?
4. **Appropriateness of `clinical_rationale`** — is the human-expert justification one a specialist would write?

The SME records concurrence in the PR via a "clinical-review: approved" comment with their name and credential (e.g., `clinical-review: approved — Dr. J. Doe, MD, board-certified rheumatology`).

If the author is the SME (the maintainer who is themselves a clinician), they state this in the PR description and self-attest.

In the absence of a credentialed SME for a specialty, the case lands with a `provisional` tag in `CASE_PROVENANCE.md` and is reviewed in the next clinical-review board sweep (per § 12).

## 12. The clinical-review board gate (Phase 2 — two-stage: formation at 100, scored sweeps at 200)

The Phase 2 board activates in two stages (see `PACCA_PRD_v2.5_Consolidated.md` § 16.7). **Formation** begins when the dataset crosses **100 cases**: recruit and charter the panel and agree the sampling protocol and κ target. **Operational scored sweeps** begin at **200 cases**. As of the 105-case state, the board is *in formation, not operational* — no scored sweep has run.

Once scored sweeps begin, each quarterly clinical-review board sweep runs as:

- A panel of 2–3 credentialed clinicians (covering the major specialties) scores a random 10% stratified sample.
- Inter-rater agreement reported as Cohen's κ.
- Cases where the panel disagrees with the cataloged `expected_outcome` are flagged for revision in the next iteration.
- The board's reports land in `docs/findings/clinical-review-board-<date>.md`.

This is the on-ramp to the FDA SaMD clinical-validation claim (per [`STATISTICAL_POWER.md`](./STATISTICAL_POWER.md) § "FDA SaMD-grade claim alignment").

## 13. After authoring — the verification workflow

1. **Run the test suite locally:** `make test` — confirm the new case parses and the test fixture aggregates it correctly.
2. **Capture a baseline:** `python -m tests.clinical.capture_baseline --rollouts 2` — generates a per-case score for the new case at the current agent state.
3. **Verify the per-case gate:** Re-run the capture; the gate should not fire (a freshly-added case at its own baseline has no regression to detect).
4. **Run a smoke evaluation:** `pytest tests/clinical/test_clinical_accuracy.py -k <case_id>` and verify the LLM-as-judge produces a score ≥ 3 (anything < 3 indicates the case is mis-specified or the agent has a real failure to address before merging).
5. **Update provenance + coverage docs** per § 10.
6. **Open the PR; tag the SME reviewer** per § 11.

## 14. Anti-patterns — do not do these

| Anti-pattern | Why it's wrong |
|---|---|
| Authoring a case to "make the suite bigger" without a stated gap or failure mode | Dilutes detection signal; adds maintenance cost without buying coverage. |
| Copying an existing case and changing the ID + one field | The new case is correlated with the original; failures on both don't actually constitute independent evidence. If you want a near-miss, put it in `near_miss_cases.py` and name the disqualifier explicitly. |
| Including real patient information | HIPAA violation. PR will be rejected and the branch deleted. |
| Inventing guideline content | Propagates into evaluation correctness. PR will be rejected at SME review. |
| Setting `reasoning_must_include = ["approved"]` (overly generic) | The judge will pass on noise. Use specific clinical phrases that distinguish good reasoning from generic reasoning. |
| Omitting `judge_scoring_criteria` | The judge defaults to a generic rubric. Cases without explicit scoring criteria get noisier scores. |
| Adding a case mid-iteration without listing it under a `chg-N` entry in the iteration manifest | Breaks the audit chain. Iter-N's "what was done" must be reconstructable from iter-N.json alone. |

## 15. Reference: the established failure-mode taxonomy

For `CASE_PROVENANCE.md`'s "Named failure mode" column, use one of:

- **Coverage** (routine positive or negative case for a gate)
- **Hallucination zero-tolerance** (sparse-docs adversarial)
- **False pattern-matching (memory trap)** (H2 memory compression failure mode)
- **Step-therapy enforcement** (must not accept patient-preference / cost-only justification)
- **Cross-condition memory bleed** (H2 entry for condition A must not generalize to condition B)
- **Test-data adequacy** (premature imaging / anti-pattern probes)
- **Discriminator (negative / ambiguous / positive) class** (complexity-score model training points)
- **Branch-N pre-flight** (positive case for branch N, where N ∈ 1..7)
- **Confidence-N boundary** (low / ambiguous / high)
- **High-cost / pediatric-complex / other policy-trigger override**

Extend only when an existing mode genuinely doesn't fit, and document the extension in `CASE_PROVENANCE.md`'s taxonomy section.

## 16. Working example — adding GC-026

Suppose we want to close the DENY-class gap with a clean denial case.

**Step 1 — state the gap.** From `EVALUATION_COVERAGE.md`: "DENY: 0 cases. Highest-priority gap." → new case is a clean denial.

**Step 2 — pick the clinical scenario.** A request for proton-beam therapy for a low-risk prostate cancer where guidelines (NCCN, ASTRO) recommend conventional radiation as first-line.

**Step 3 — fill the template:**

```python
GoldenCase(
    case_id="GC-026",
    title="Low-risk prostate proton-beam — denied per NCCN/ASTRO (conventional first-line)",
    diagnosis_code="C61",
    diagnosis_description="Malignant neoplasm of prostate",
    procedure_code="77523",
    procedure_description="Proton-beam radiation therapy",
    clinical_notes=(
        "62-year-old male with newly-diagnosed low-risk prostate adenocarcinoma "
        "(Gleason 3+3=6, PSA 5.2, clinical stage T1c). No prior therapy. "
        "Requesting proton-beam radiation therapy. No documented contraindication "
        "to conventional external-beam radiation therapy. Patient preference cited "
        "as justification ('fewer side effects')."
    ),
    guidelines_context=(
        "NCCN Prostate Cancer Guidelines + ASTRO Model Policy on Proton-Beam: "
        "proton-beam radiation is NOT recommended over conventional intensity-"
        "modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for low-risk prostate cancer in the "
        "absence of a documented contraindication to IMRT. CMS National Coverage "
        "Determination 110.8.1 mirrors this position. Patient preference is not "
        "an accepted justification for the cost differential."
    ),
    expected_outcome=ExpectedOutcome.DENIED,
    expected_branch=EscalationBranch.NONE,
    reasoning_must_include=["low-risk", "IMRT", "patient preference"],
    reasoning_must_not_include=["approved", "auto-approve"],
    clinical_rationale=(
        "Clean denial case: low-risk prostate cancer with no contraindication to "
        "conventional IMRT, requesting a substantially more expensive modality "
        "with patient preference as the only justification. NCCN, ASTRO, and CMS "
        "NCD all align — proton-beam is not indicated here. Step-therapy "
        "enforcement principle (cf. GC-005) applies: patient preference is not "
        "an acceptable substitute for documented clinical justification."
    ),
    judge_scoring_criteria=(
        "Score highly if the rationale explicitly cites low-risk status, the "
        "guidelines' first-line recommendation for IMRT, the absence of a "
        "contraindication, and the rejection of patient preference as "
        "justification. Penalize for auto-approval or for IN_REVIEW (this case "
        "has unambiguous guideline alignment supporting denial)."
    ),
),
```

**Step 4 — wire up the docs** per § 10:

- `CASE_PROVENANCE.md`: new row `| GC-026 | golden_cases.py | Proton-beam for low-risk prostate; NCCN/ASTRO/CMS NCD all favor IMRT first-line; patient-preference-only justification | **Coverage** (DENY class — closes 0 → 1 gap from EVALUATION_COVERAGE.md); also step-therapy enforcement parallel to GC-005 | iter-6 |`
- `EVALUATION_COVERAGE.md`: bump DENY count to 1 in the outcome-distribution table.
- `DATASET_SUFFICIENCY.md`: bump total to 26.

**Step 5 — verify** per § 13.

**Step 6 — open PR with SME tag** per § 11.

This is the workflow every case follows.
