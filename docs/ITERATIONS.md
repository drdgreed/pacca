# PACCA Harness Engineering — Iteration Narratives

> **What this is:** the narrative log of PACCA's harness engineering cycle. Each iteration tag (`harness-iter-N`) gets a section structured in the format of Lin et al., *Agentic Harness Engineering* (arXiv:2604.25850, 2026), Appendix C: failure pattern → change shipped → trajectory before/after on a representative case → eval delta.
>
> **What this is for:** the engineering narrative that complements the audit log in [`DECISIONS.md`](./DECISIONS.md). DECISIONS.md is the structured record (manifest + verdict). This file is the story — what the failure looked like in the trajectory log, why we believed the chosen constraint level was right, what the passing case looked like after the fix, and what the eval delta confirmed or rejected. A reader who wants the data goes to DECISIONS.md; a reader who wants the reasoning comes here.
>
> **Reading this document:** entries are reverse-chronological after the seed (newest at top). Each iteration's narrative cites the corresponding manifest entries in DECISIONS.md and the relevant trajectory log paths. Entries are written shortly after the iteration's evaluation round completes — early enough that the engineering reasoning is fresh, late enough that the verdict is known.
>
> **Format authority:** narrative format adapted from Lin et al. (2026), Appendix C. See [`docs/HARNESS.md`](./HARNESS.md) for the methodology and [`harness/manifests/change_manifest.schema.json`](../harness/manifests/change_manifest.schema.json) for the manifest schema this narrative references.

## iter-6 — Adult complexity pre-flight + first deny-class H2 entry + full structlog migration

**Tag:** `harness-iter-6`
**Phase:** mixed — instrumentation completion (chg-1), escalation generalization (chg-2), eval expansion (chg-3), H2 first deny-class entry (chg-4)
**Date:** 2026-05-31
**Changes:** 4 (sequenced low → high risk)
**Eval delta:** golden-20 held **100% (20/20), mean 4.9**, distribution identical to iter-5 (GC-009 + GC-012 at 4, all others at 5; zero jitter across 2 rollouts). Adult eval cases route as designed (GC-101/GC-103 IN_REVIEW, GC-102 AUTO_APPROVED); GC-035 DENIED at confidence 0.96 with the specific benefit-cap basis and appeal pathway cited; GC-005 stayed IN_REVIEW. No behavioral predicted_fixes — chg-2/3/4 add capability, coverage, and guardrails, not case repairs.

### What this iteration shipped, and the thread it closes

iter-6 is the iteration that **met all three of iter-5's "what success
looks like" threads** — the first time in the cycle that a prior
iteration's forward-looking predictions were satisfied in full, in one
branch:

1. **Generalize the complexity-score model beyond pediatric cases** →
   chg-2 adds `EscalationReason.ADULT_COMPLEX` and `_check_adult_complex`,
   reusing iter-5 chg-3's `_compute_complexity_score` **unchanged**.
2. **A fourth H2 memory entry on a *deny* pattern** → chg-4 adds the
   first deny-class entry (benefit-cap exhaustion), the methodology's
   first test that institutional memory works for denial, not just
   approval.
3. **The full structlog migration** → chg-1 finishes the stopgap iter-5
   chg-1 deliberately left in place.

The four changes span four constraint levels (`instrumentation`,
`escalation_branch`, `evaluation_harness`, `long_term_memory`) and were
landed in ascending risk order on the `harness/iter-6` branch via PR,
each gated by the `reviewer` HIPAA/security subagent before commit.

### chg-2 — the score model generalized without modification (and needed no orchestrator edit)

The headline finding of iter-6 is a **non-event**: generalizing
complexity escalation from pediatrics to adults required **zero changes
to `_compute_complexity_score`**. chg-2's commit is additions-only (122
insertions, 0 deletions): a new `EscalationReason.ADULT_COMPLEX` enum
member and a new `_check_adult_complex` method that mirrors
`_check_pediatric_complex`, gated on `age >= 18` and firing when the
score reaches `settings.complexity_specialist_review_min` (=4). The
pediatric branch and the score function are byte-for-byte untouched.

This is the **strongest possible validation of the iter-5 chg-3
constraint-level choice**. iter-5 framed the score model honestly as "a
heuristic in score-model clothing" — defensible per-feature, not
data-fit. The open question that framing left was whether the model was
genuinely general or merely a pediatric heuristic dressed up. iter-6
answers it: a second age band consumed the same function, the same
threshold setting, and the same weighted-sum semantics with no edit. A
score model that generalizes to a new population without modification is
behaving like a model; one that needed bespoke re-tuning per population
would have been a heuristic after all. The `escalation_branch`
constraint level — not `system_prompt` — is why the change compounded.

A second finding, recorded because the design spec anticipated
otherwise: **no orchestrator edit was required.** The iter-6 design
flagged a "deferred routing site" in the orchestrator where a new
escalation reason might need a branch-mapping entry. That site does not
exist — branch dispatch is generic over `EscalationReason`, so a new
reason routes to specialist pre-review without a mapping change. The
design's predicted edit was a phantom; the honest record says so.

### chg-3 — adult eval cases, with a negative control

chg-2 added the adult branch; chg-3 gives it the data to prove it.
`tests/clinical/adult_complexity_cases.py` adds `ADULT_COMPLEXITY_CASES`
(GC-101, GC-102, GC-103), parallel to iter-5's `PEDIATRIC_CASES` and
the iter-2 `NEAR_MISS_CASES` precedent. The design that matters here is
**GC-102 as a negative control**: a low-complexity adult that must
*not* escalate. Without it, GC-101 and GC-103 routing IN_REVIEW would
only prove the branch *can* fire, not that it fires *selectively*.
GC-102 auto-approving proves the branch discriminates on the
complexity score, not on adult age alone — the same
"avoid escalating on demographics" property iter-5 verified for GC-023
on the pediatric side. `GOLDEN_CASES` stays at 20; the count-integrity
assertion holds.

### chg-4 — the first deny-class memory entry, and an honest fix-vs-hardening finding

chg-4 ships the cycle's first deny-class H2 entry: "Outpatient
benefit-cap exhaustion without a documented exception," anchored on
GC-035. The three prior entries (NSCLC, RA, asthma) are all approve-class
biologics. A deny-class entry inverts the dangerous failure mode: an
approve entry's risk is over-approval; a deny entry's risk is **false
denial** — denying a case that has a documented exception. The entry is
built around that risk. Five required criteria gate the deny shortcut;
five anti-patterns each resolve to `**Status: IN_REVIEW.** (Not DENIED.)`;
a governing rule mandates IN_REVIEW on any uncertainty ("absence of
evidence is not evidence of ineligibility"). PROMPT_REGISTRY bumps
v2.5 → v2.6.

**The honest finding, stated plainly: this change is hardening, not a
fix.** GC-035 was *already* DENIED 5/5 at the pre-entry baseline (Step
5a, captured before the memory edit). The agent denied benefit-cap
exhaustion correctly on its own guideline reading without any deny-class
memory. So chg-4 does not flip a failing case to passing — it encodes
the institutional reasoning and installs the over-denial guardrail.
Claiming a "fix" here would inflate the manifest's fix-precision record
against the AHE paper's own honesty standard. The manifest's
`predicted_fixes` is empty; this narrative says hardening.

The guardrail was verified in both directions. Post-entry, GC-035 still
DENIED (confidence 0.96), and its rationale now enumerates all five
benefit-cap criteria and cites the specific benefit-document basis plus
the appeal/exception pathway — correct denial, *better explained*. An
ephemeral probe (GC-035 with a documented acute new injury, not
committed) routed **IN_REVIEW**: the agent quoted the entry's anti-pattern
and governing rule verbatim. The deny shortcut does not become reflexive
when an exception is on the record.

### The re-anchor, and the iter-7 finding it surfaced

The runbook scoped this entry for off-label oncology, anchored on
GC-034. It was re-anchored to GC-035 mid-iteration for a concrete
reason that is itself the next iteration's seed: **GC-034 never reaches
the agent.** `_check_experimental_treatment` substring-scans
`EXPERIMENTAL_DIAGNOSIS_KEYWORDS` (which includes "off-label") with no
negation handling, so GC-034 pre-escalates to IN_REVIEW at the pre-flight
stage — before the `DecisionSupportAgent`, and therefore before the H2
memory, ever runs. A deny entry anchored on a case that short-circuits
upstream of the memory could never be exercised through the agent path.
GC-035 (benefit-cap, no experimental keywords) routes to the agent
cleanly, so the entry can actually be tested.

The off-label↔experimental contradiction is a real harness bug at a
*different* constraint level (the pre-flight detector, not memory).
Fixing it inside a memory change would have crossed constraint levels —
exactly the move the methodology warns against. It is logged here as the
**iter-7 finding**: a keyword scanner that cannot tell "this is off-label"
from "this is not off-label, and not experimental" will mis-route any
case whose notes mention the keyword in a negated or contrastive context.

### Eval delta

| Case(s) | Routing at iter-6 HEAD | Note |
|---|---|---|
| GOLDEN_CASES (20) | **20/20 pass, mean 4.9** | Identical to iter-5; GC-009 + GC-012 at 4, rest at 5; zero jitter across 2 rollouts |
| GC-101 (adult, high complexity) | IN_REVIEW | chg-2 `ADULT_COMPLEX` fired |
| GC-102 (adult, low complexity) | AUTO_APPROVED | negative control — branch did not over-fire on adult age |
| GC-103 (adult, high complexity) | IN_REVIEW | chg-2 `ADULT_COMPLEX` fired |
| GC-035 (benefit-cap exhausted) | DENIED (0.96) | correct denial preserved, now cites the specific cap basis + appeal pathway |
| GC-035 + documented exception (ephemeral) | IN_REVIEW | over-denial guard fired; not committed |
| GC-005 (psoriasis) | IN_REVIEW | deny entry did not bleed into a medical-necessity case |

The golden-20 held at iter-5's exact distribution — no change of any of
the four chgs regressed a golden case. Because the adult and deny cases
live in their own lists (`ADULT_COMPLEXITY_CASES`, `DENIAL_CASES`), the
20-case `capture_baseline` scoreboard is unchanged by design; their
routing was verified at the per-chg live gates.

### Verdict summary on iter-5's four changes

All four iter-5 changes carry forward; one improves, three keep
(recorded in [`harness/manifests/iter-6.json`](../harness/manifests/iter-6.json) `verdicts[]`):

- **iter-5 chg-1 → `improve`.** The `extra={...}` stdlib wrap held green
  through iter-5 and was correct, but kept tracing on stdlib logging
  rather than the intended structlog substrate. iter-6 chg-1 supersedes
  it with `structlog.get_logger`: intent preserved, mechanism refined.
  The textbook "improve" verdict.
- **iter-5 chg-2 → `keep`.** The pediatric eval set is reused unchanged;
  iter-6 chg-3 mirrors its file pattern for adults.
- **iter-5 chg-3 → `keep`** — the strongest "keep" the cycle has
  recorded. `_compute_complexity_score` is reused byte-for-byte by
  iter-6 chg-2's adult path. The model generalized to a second
  population without a single edit.
- **iter-5 chg-4 → `keep`.** The third H2 entry (asthma) is stable;
  iter-6 chg-4 adds a fourth without displacing it. The
  criterion-preservation tests for all four entries pass together; the
  anti-pattern (`Not DENIED`) count floor was raised 16 → 21 to lock the
  new deny-class guards in.

### Reflection: the cycle at iter-6 close

Two observations worth recording.

**A score model that generalizes without modification retroactively
justifies its constraint level.** iter-5 chg-3's honest framing left an
open question — heuristic or model? iter-6 chg-2 answers it empirically:
the function consumed a new population with zero edits. This is the
clearest case study the cycle has produced for the AHE paper's central
claim that *the constraint level determines whether a change compounds*.
A system-prompt encoding of the same logic would have needed adult-specific
re-prompting; the `escalation_branch` encoding generalized for free.

**The methodology generated its own next finding.** The chg-4 re-anchor
was not a detour — it surfaced the off-label↔experimental contradiction
that becomes iter-7's seed. This is the cycle behaving as designed: each
iteration's execution produces the next iteration's spec fragment. iter-3
produced the H2 forward-design notes; iter-4 produced the dataset survey
that scoped iter-5; iter-6 produced the pre-flight negation-handling
finding. The honest fix-vs-hardening call on chg-4 is the same discipline
in a different place: the record is more useful when it refuses to claim
a fix it did not make.

## iter-5 — Pediatric data + complexity-score model + third H2 entry + structlog cleanup

**Tag:** `harness-iter-5`
**Phase:** mixed — pediatric data expansion (chg-2), policy logic refinement (chg-3), H2 third entry (chg-4), instrumentation cleanup (chg-1)
**Date:** 2026-05-25
**Changes:** 4 (largest iteration by change count in the cycle so far)
**Eval delta:** all 4 chg-3 + chg-4 risk cases (GC-012, GC-023, GC-024, GC-025) score ≥ 4 first-pass. iter-3's keyword heuristic replaced with an integer 1-5 score model; iter-3's tracing.py type-ignores cleared; third H2 entry shipped with documented non-override of both pre-flight policy checks.

### What this iteration shipped

iter-5 is the cycle's broadest iteration so far — four changes spanning
four constraint levels (`instrumentation`, `evaluation_harness`,
`escalation_branch`, `long_term_memory`). The changes are well-scoped
individually; what's new is the cross-iteration *interaction surface*
they exercise. The chg-4 asthma memory entry documents non-override of
**both** the iter-3 chg-1 cost check AND the new iter-5 chg-3
pediatric_complex check. GC-012 is the canonical case where all three
contracts converge: severe pediatric eosinophilic asthma satisfies the
memory's clinical criteria AND the pediatric_complex check correctly
escalates. The agent's rationale cites both, the judge praises both,
and the cycle's "memory as support, not replacement" contract has its
strongest test yet.

### The complexity-score model: honest framing matters

chg-3 replaces the iter-3 keyword heuristic ("if severity language
matches 'severe' / 'moderate-to-severe' / 'complex' / 'critical' →
escalate") with an integer 1-5 complexity-score model. Weighted-sum:
age extremes +2, severity tier +0 to +3, 2+ prior failures +1,
comorbidities +1, clamped to [1, 5]. Pediatric escalation threshold = 3.
All 4 pediatric data points route correctly: GC-012 (score 4),
GC-023 (score 2 — below threshold, AUTO_APPROVED), GC-024 (score 4),
GC-025 (score 5).

The iteration's most defensible methodological move is the **honest
framing in the commit message and the manifest**: *"This is a
HEURISTIC IN SCORE-MODEL CLOTHING, not a data-fit discriminator.
PACCA's dataset has 4 pediatric data points — enough to defend a
per-feature weighting based on clinical rationale, not enough to
'train' a model. The defensibility comes from each feature having a
clinical reason, the integer 1-5 range matching the existing schema,
and the four data points validating the chosen weights against
expected outcomes."*

Overstating empirical grounding would have been easy. The model has
the *form* of a discriminator and the *behavior* of a discriminator;
calling it a "score model" without qualification is technically true.
The honest qualifier — "with 4 data points" — keeps the methodology
record defensible. A future iteration with 10+ pediatric data points
could legitimately re-tune the weights and call it a fit.

### The dataset expansion that made the score model defensible

chg-2 added three pediatric cases (GC-023 mild well-controlled, GC-024
moderate ambiguous, GC-025 severe in a different condition) following
the dataset survey at iter-4 close. The survey identified that the
entire 22-case dataset had exactly one pediatric case (GC-012). One
data point couldn't found a score-based discriminator. Three new cases
spanning the discriminator's input space (below, at, above threshold)
are still few but enable per-feature validation against expected
outcomes.

The chg-2 file structure mirrors the iter-2 NEAR_MISS_CASES precedent
exactly: a separate `PEDIATRIC_CASES` list in
`tests/clinical/pediatric_cases.py`, wired into the live clinical gate
loop alongside GOLDEN_CASES + NEAR_MISS_CASES. GOLDEN_CASES stays at
20; the `test_dataset_has_twenty_cases` integrity assertion is
preserved. Same separation-as-discrimination-suite pattern.

### The third H2 entry, and the dual-policy-check non-override

chg-4 ships the third H2 memory entry: dupilumab for severe
eosinophilic asthma. Mirrors the iter-3 NSCLC and iter-4 RA entry
formats exactly (5 required criteria, 5 anti-patterns each ending
`**Status: IN_REVIEW.** (Not DENIED.)`, explicit when-applies /
when-not-applies sections). PROMPT_REGISTRY bumps v2.4 → v2.5.

The new design element: the entry documents non-override of **both**
pre-flight policy checks — iter-3 chg-1's `high_cost_check` AND iter-5
chg-3's `pediatric_complex` check. GC-012 is the canonical interaction
case. Live verification confirms: GC-012 routes to IN_REVIEW via the
pediatric_complex check; the agent's rationale cites both the
pediatric trigger and (when prompted) the clinical-eligibility
satisfaction; the memory did not override the policy escalation.
GC-023 (mild pediatric asthma) auto-approves cleanly; the memory did
not over-fire on a case that doesn't match the severity criterion.

### The structlog-style cleanup that earned out

chg-1 closes the iter-3 chg-1 TODO comment by wrapping three
structlog-style kwargs in `extra={...}` instead of switching to
`structlog` (no new dependency added). The three `# type: ignore[call-arg]`
markers from iter-3 are removed. This was the smallest, safest change
in iter-5 — landed first to prove the branch worked before larger
behavioral work.

### Tangential type-fix work the iteration absorbed

iter-3 chg-1's `py.typed` marker continues to surface pre-existing
untyped code as the import graph gets walked deeper by each iteration's
new files. iter-5 added 6 tangential type-fix markers (across
`authorization.py`, `base.py`, `test_clinical_accuracy.py`) and 2
additional pre-commit hook dependencies (`pytest`, `pytest-asyncio`).
The pattern by now is well-established: each iteration that touches a
new import surface absorbs the type-debt that surface contains, with
explicit TODO comments where the fix is non-trivial.

This is a feature of the methodology, not a bug. Inline tooling fixes
landed during substantive work are amortized against meaningful
changes; standalone "lint cleanup" iterations have no other forcing
function. iter-5 is now four iterations into the py.typed cascade
without a dedicated cleanup iteration — and the cumulative fixes are
all defensible, narrowly scoped, and explicitly documented.

### What success looks like for iter-6

Three threads:

1. **Generalize the complexity-score model beyond pediatric cases.**
   The iter-5 chg-3 model is currently scoped to `_check_pediatric_complex`
   only. The `Settings.complexity_specialist_review_min=4` threshold
   exists for adult cases too. A non-pediatric complexity check is a
   straightforward next iteration when a non-pediatric case justifies
   it (e.g. an adult with multiple failures + comorbidities that
   warrants specialist review even without cost or pediatric triggers).

2. **Fourth H2 memory entry.** The three current entries cover NSCLC,
   RA, and severe eosinophilic asthma. A fourth on a fundamentally
   different decision pattern (e.g. a *deny* case like the GC-005
   psoriasis-without-step-therapy class) would test that H2 entries
   work for denial patterns too, not just approve patterns.

3. **The structlog migration (full).** chg-1 took the
   minimum-change path (wrap with `extra={...}`). A full migration to
   `structlog` would clear the `# type: ignore` markers in `base.py`
   (the tenacity decorator + the Anthropic SDK overload) and put
   PACCA on a unified structured-logging foundation. Standalone
   iteration; no behavioral risk.

### Reflection: the cycle at iter-5 close

The cycle has now produced six distinct iteration types:

- **iter-0:** baseline crystallization (instrumentation seed)
- **iter-1:** structural refactor (Component Decoupling)
- **iter-2:** eval-net hardening (no behavioral change)
- **iter-3:** first behavioral change (escalation + H2 + eval-net polish)
- **iter-4:** behavioral consolidation (second H2 entry + cleanup)
- **iter-5:** broad iteration (data + model + H2 + instrumentation)

iter-5 is the first iteration that combined a *data* expansion, a
*model* change that depends on the data, an *agent-surface* memory
entry that depends on the model, AND an unrelated cleanup chg into
one branch. The interaction surface — chg-2 enables chg-3 enables
chg-4 documents-interaction-with-chg-3 — is the most complex
dependency graph the cycle has executed. It landed cleanly with all
risk cases preserved, demonstrating that the prior iterations'
infrastructure (per-case regression gate, criterion-preservation
tests, live verification on risk cases, runbook-driven execution
with branch + PR workflow) scales to this complexity.

## iter-4 — Second H2 Memory Entry + decision_agent.py Deletion

**Tag:** `harness-iter-4`
**Phase:** H2 expansion (second entry) + iter-1 deferred cleanup
**Date:** 2026-05-25
**Changes:** 2 (`chg-1` long_term_memory; `chg-2` tool_implementation removal)
**Eval delta:** baseline aggregate **100% unchanged** (20/20 with zero jitter across 2 rollouts — identical scores to iter-3-final). All 4 chg-1 risk cases scored 5 first-pass; chg-2 deleted 330 lines of dead code with zero test impact.

### What this iteration shipped

iter-4 is a **small-but-substantive** iteration. After iter-3's
ambitious first-behavioral-change work (escalation completion + H2
first entry + eval-net polish), iter-4 ships two well-scoped changes
that fit cleanly into one PR:

- **chg-1 (long_term_memory):** second H2 memory entry — first-line
  biologic DMARD for seropositive RA after conventional DMARD failure.
  Follows the forward design notes from
  [`docs/findings/H2-memory-iteration-1.md`](./findings/H2-memory-iteration-1.md)
  exactly: explicit status routing per anti-pattern, risk-case
  enumeration with live verification, criterion-preservation test
  extension, PROMPT_REGISTRY bump v2.3 → v2.4.

- **chg-2 (tool_implementation removal):** `src/pacca/agents/decision_agent.py`
  (330 lines of dead code) deleted. Queued since iter-1 (recorded in
  `iter-1.json` chg-1's evidence block, re-noted in every iter
  narrative since). Zero importers across the codebase; full suite
  unchanged at 192 → 192 tests post-deletion.

### The methodology compounding, in two observations

**iter-3 chg-2 needed a mid-iteration regression fix on GC-021. iter-4
chg-1 needed zero.** That's the entire point of this iteration's
narrative. The chg-2 finding doc from iter-3
([`docs/findings/H2-memory-iteration-1.md`](./findings/H2-memory-iteration-1.md))
prescribed specific forward design notes for every future H2 entry:
explicit status routing on every anti-pattern (`**Status: IN_REVIEW.**
(Not DENIED.)`), risk-case enumeration with live verification before
the entry lands, criterion-preservation test extension, version bump.
iter-4 chg-1 followed those notes literally. All four risk cases
scored 5 first-pass — GC-010 (IN_REVIEW via cost, judge cites
"regardless of clinical eligibility per policy"), GC-005 (psoriasis,
AAD-NPF cited — no RA-memory bleed), GC-017 (PsA, ACR PsA Guidelines
cited — no bleed), GC-016 (Crohn's, ACG cited — no interference).

The cycle is now producing findings that turn into clean second
implementations. That's the methodology being self-aware: each
iteration's record is a spec fragment for the iterations that follow.
The cost of writing
[`H2-memory-iteration-1.md`](./findings/H2-memory-iteration-1.md) was
~30 minutes at iter-3 close; the benefit was zero mid-iteration
debugging on iter-4 chg-1.

**The dataset survey at iter-4 start scoped the complexity-score
model out of iter-4 — and made the scoping itself defensible.**
[`docs/findings/GC-012.md`](./findings/GC-012.md) had recorded the
deferral with the conservative rule: "defer until a second pediatric
case forces the distinction." iter-4 made the survey rigorous: the
entire 22-case dataset (20 GOLDEN + 2 NEAR_MISS) contains exactly
**one** pediatric case (GC-012). A discriminator needs contrastive
data on both sides of its threshold — with one data point, any
score-model fit would just be the keyword heuristic with extra
steps. The defensible path forward (recorded in
`RUNBOOK_iter4.md`'s final section) is a small data-only iter-5
candidate that adds 2–3 pediatric cases (mild + moderate ambiguous +
severe in a different condition) before a complexity-score iteration
can be empirically founded.

### The RA entry's interaction with iter-3 chg-1's cost check

iter-4 chg-1's most interesting design choice is the **explicit
documentation of the memory's non-override of iter-3 chg-1's
`high_cost_check`**. The RA entry's "When the shortcut applies"
section says auto-approval is "conditional on" the policy-level
cost check, and a separate "Important interaction with policy
escalation" paragraph teaches the agent the right phrasing when
the pre-flight has fired: *"criteria met but cost escalates per
policy"* rather than the incorrect *"criteria met → approve"*.

This is the cleanest possible test of the *memory as support, not
replacement* contract from
[`docs/findings/GC-001.md`](./findings/GC-001.md). GC-010 has clinical
criteria fully met (seropositive RA, DMARD failures documented, ACR-
recommended biologic) and the cost trigger fires at $288K. Without
the explicit interaction documentation, the memory could plausibly
override the cost escalation by claiming clinical merit justifies
auto-approval. With it, the agent cites both — the clinical
satisfaction AND the cost-trigger escalation. GC-010 scored 5 with
the judge praising the explicit policy-trigger reasoning. The memory
support did not bleed into a policy override.

### chg-2 — the cleanest commit in the cycle

The `decision_agent.py` deletion was queued in iter-1's manifest as
*"chg-2"* — a planned iter-1 follow-up that never landed because
iter-2 pivoted to eval-net work and iter-3 to H2 + escalation. iter-4
was the first iteration with bandwidth for the cleanup. 330 lines
deleted; zero importers (verified by `grep -rn`); full suite
unchanged at 192 → 192 tests; no behavioral surface affected.

The historical lesson: dead-code deletion is *easier when you wait
until the cycle has bandwidth for it*. Forcing it earlier (e.g.
into iter-1's chg-2 slot) would have absorbed iteration capacity
better spent on the methodology-establishing work. The deletion is
a 30-second commit. The runbook ordering choice (chg-2 before
chg-1 to clean the import graph before extending it) was the right
call — it added zero time and gave chg-1 a cleaner baseline.

### Verdict on iter-3's predictions and risks

iter-3 shipped three changes. All three preserved at iter-4 HEAD:

- **chg-1 (HIGH_COST + PEDIATRIC_COMPLEX):** verified_fixes
  `["GC-010", "GC-012"]` both still routing correctly at iter-4
  HEAD with the new memory entry active. The iter-4 chg-1 RA memory's
  explicit cost-check interaction confirms `high_cost_check` remains
  the authoritative escalation path. Confirmed keep.
- **chg-2 (H2 NSCLC pembrolizumab entry):** all three named risk
  cases (GC-001, GC-021, GC-022) preserved with the second entry
  active alongside. Criterion-preservation tests for both entries
  pass — the second entry did not displace the first's criteria.
  Confirmed keep.
- **chg-3 (regression_gate noise_threshold + --rollouts):** tooling
  used to capture iter-4's baseline with `--rollouts 2`. The
  distributions field shows zero jitter in this capture (identical
  to iter-3-final pattern). The `noise_threshold` parameter is
  unused in this iteration because there are no real regressions
  to test it against — but the prophylactic infrastructure is in
  place. Confirmed keep.

### What success looks like for iter-5

Three threads worth pursuing in iter-5:

1. **Pediatric case-set expansion (data-only iteration).** Add 2–3
   pediatric cases to the golden dataset: one MILD case that should
   auto-approve (e.g. 10yo with mild well-controlled asthma), one
   MODERATE ambiguous case (e.g. 16yo with moderate Crohn's on
   first-line), one SEVERE case in a different condition (e.g. 9yo
   with severe atopic dermatitis on biologic). This is data-engineering
   work, not behavioral — it doesn't need a runbook, just careful
   case authoring with the same `GoldenCase` dataclass + the
   in-iteration live-verification pattern.

2. **Then (iter-6 candidate) complexity-score model.** With contrastive
   pediatric data in hand, fit a numeric `complexity_score` model
   using the `COMPLEXITY_AUTO_APPROVE_MAX` and
   `COMPLEXITY_SPECIALIST_REVIEW_MIN` settings that already exist in
   `.env` but nothing reads. This is the iteration the iter-3
   chg-1 deferral was waiting for.

3. **Third H2 memory entry.** Asthma dupilumab is the next candidate
   (GC-012's case family). It would test the H2 forward design notes
   for a third entry on a *third* disease/biologic family, further
   validating that the methodology generalizes. Follows the same
   pattern as iter-4 chg-1.

A fourth optional thread: **structured logger migration.** iter-3 chg-1
left three `# type: ignore[call-arg]` comments in
`src/pacca/config/tracing.py` marking structlog-style
`logger.warning(event, detail=...)` calls against stdlib `logging.Logger`.
A small iter-5 chg could switch to `structlog` (or wrap with `extra={...}`)
and remove the ignores. Standalone cleanup with no behavioral risk.

### Reflection: the cycle at iter-4 close

The v2.3 harness-engineering cycle has now produced five distinct
iteration types:

- **iter-0:** baseline crystallization (instrumentation seed)
- **iter-1:** structural refactor (Component Decoupling)
- **iter-2:** eval-net hardening (no behavioral change)
- **iter-3:** first behavioral change (escalation + H2 + eval-net polish)
- **iter-4:** behavioral consolidation (second H2 entry + deferred cleanup)

The shape of this iteration sequence is the methodology's own product:
each iteration's deliverables earn the next iteration's bandwidth.
iter-1's byte-identity check pattern earned iter-3's criterion-
preservation check. iter-2's eval-net hardening earned iter-3's
behavioral-change safety. iter-3's H2 memory finding earned iter-4
chg-1's clean first-pass. The cycle is producing transferable
artifacts, not just metrics.

### Files changed in this iteration

**Behavioral:**
`src/pacca/agents/decision_support/long_term_memory.md` (chg-1: second entry appended),
`src/pacca/agents/prompts/templates.py` (chg-1: PROMPT_REGISTRY v2.3 → v2.4).

**Removal:** `src/pacca/agents/decision_agent.py` (chg-2: deleted, 330 lines).

**Tests:** `tests/unit/test_h2_memory_criterion_preservation.py` (chg-1: 16 new tests, total H2 tests now 35).

**Baseline:** `tests/clinical/baselines/iter-4-baseline.json` (live capture at HEAD with `--rollouts 2`).

**Documentation:** `docs/ITERATIONS.md` (this section), `docs/DECISIONS.md` (iter-4 entries), `harness/manifests/iter-4.json`, `RUNBOOK_iter4.md`.

## iter-3 — H2 Institutional Memory + Escalation-Branch Completion

**Tag:** `harness-iter-3`
**Phase:** H2 (Institutional Memory Layer) + completion of branch_2 escalation work surfaced by iter-2
**Date:** 2026-05-24
**Changes:** 3 (`chg-1` escalation_branch; `chg-2` long_term_memory; `chg-3` evaluation_harness)
**Eval delta:** aggregate clinical accuracy **90% → 100%** (18/20 → 20/20). Both predicted_fixes verified live (GC-010 1→5, GC-012 2→4). Risk cases preserved: GC-001 stable at 5, GC-021 IN_REVIEW (after in-iteration fix), GC-022 IN_REVIEW.

### What this iteration shipped

iter-3 is the cycle's **first behavioral-change iteration**. After iter-2's
deliberately non-behavioral eval-net hardening, iter-3 ships three changes
that exercise the safety net the prior iteration built. The order matters:
chg-1 completes the escalation-logic gaps iter-2 surfaced, chg-2 introduces
the Phase H2 institutional-memory layer (the AHE paper's highest-leverage
single component), chg-3 hardens the per-case regression gate against the
LLM-as-judge variance that iter-2's findings predicted would otherwise
swamp the signal.

The runbook (`RUNBOOK_iter3.md`) prescribed the order, the verification
gates per change, and the design decisions locked at iteration start
(hybrid structured-field-plus-parser-fallback for chg-1; one memory entry
for chg-2 with criterion-preservation contract; strict default for chg-3's
noise_threshold with documented production override). All three landed
on the `harness/iter-3` branch via PR #5, restoring the project's
branch-and-PR workflow after iter-2's accidental direct-to-main drift.

### chg-1 — Completing a half-built feature

Both `EscalationReason.HIGH_COST` and `EscalationReason.PEDIATRIC_COMPLEX`
existed in `src/pacca/models/enums.py` since before iter-1. The Settings
schema even had `HIGH_COST_THRESHOLD` and `COMPLEXITY_AUTO_APPROVE_MAX`
configured in `.env`. What was missing: any code that read those values
and routed cases. iter-2 chg-6's diagnostic work surfaced both gaps as
SEV-2 findings; iter-3 chg-1 closes them.

The design decision was hybrid data flow. `ClinicalCase` gained three
optional structured fields (`estimated_annual_cost`, `patient_age`,
`disease_severity`). The new `_check_high_cost` and `_check_pediatric_complex`
methods read those first, falling back to regex parsing of `clinical_notes`
when the field is `None`. Both code paths got unit tests. The parser-fallback
path is the one that matters for the existing golden cases (whose data
lives in prose); the structured-field path is the one that will matter
for production upstream populated data.

The cost parser had a bug a smoke-test caught before unit tests existed.
First version preferred the first dollar amount that followed an "annual
cost" phrase, which on GC-010's `"$24,000/infusion x 12 = $288,000"` text
returned the per-infusion figure rather than the totalled annual one.
Switching to "max of all dollar amounts" fixed it. The pattern this
demonstrates is worth recording: when the parser's contract is "extract
the figure the policy cares about," and the prose lists multiple figures,
prefer max over positional heuristics — the totalled figure is almost
always the largest.

Live verification at chg-1 HEAD captured the two predicted fixes
unambiguously: GC-010 `1 → 5` (judge text: *"correctly escalated to
IN_REVIEW based on the high-cost threshold"*) and GC-012 `2 → 4` (judge
text: *"correctly identified all clinical criteria… correctly escalated
based on pediatric complexity"*). GC-001 stayed at 5 (no false-positive
firing on the canonical clean case).

The chg-1 baseline-capture run also surfaced two apparent regressions
(GC-005 5→2 and GC-017 4→2) that turned out to be judge jitter on
investigation — the same agent behavior re-ran produced the original
scores. Both observations fed directly into the chg-3 design.

### chg-2 — The H2 memory entry, and the mid-iteration debugging cycle that taught the methodology

Phase H2 in the AHE paper is the cycle's biggest behavioral-leverage
target. PACCA's iter-3 chg-2 ships exactly one entry — the NSCLC pembrolizumab
pattern that GC-001 / GC-021 / GC-022 form a sibling family for. Per the
iter-2 findings design constraints, the memory file enumerates the FULL
criteria set (six required criteria; five anti-patterns) and the prompt
loader's `{% if long_term_memory %}` guard ensures agents without a memory
file still render byte-identical prompts.

The headline event of chg-2 wasn't the architecture (clean: 7-line loader
change, single-file memory mount-point, criterion-preservation tests
pass). It was the live verification on GC-021.

The first-pass memory wording said "Route to IN_REVIEW" five times — once
per anti-pattern — and the agent, encountering a near-miss case where TWO
anti-patterns matched (PD-L1 45% AND stage IIIA, which was the original
GC-001 contradiction that iter-2 chg-6 had fixed in GC-001 but not in
its near-miss sibling), generalized "two anti-patterns matched" into
`DENIED`. Routed to denial instead of human review. Score `2`. The
criterion-preservation test passed (every anti-pattern was present in the
rendered prompt verbatim) but the agent's behavioral interpretation of
the wording was wrong.

The fix was wording-level: every anti-pattern now ends with
`**Status: IN_REVIEW.** (Not DENIED.)` and a "Why this distinction
matters" paragraph closes the anti-pattern list. After the fix, GC-021
re-ran scored **5** with the judge text *"demonstrates genuine
case-by-case analysis rather than pattern-matching to a canonical
approval case"* — exactly the behavior the H2 design contract was
meant to produce.

This iteration's most valuable methodology learning is in
[`docs/findings/H2-memory-iteration-1.md`](./findings/H2-memory-iteration-1.md):
**memory writing is closer to prompt engineering than data engineering.**
A memory entry is not a passive lookup row; it is a structured prompt
fragment the agent reasons over. The criterion-preservation test is
necessary but not sufficient — it guarantees the entry's *content* is
intact, not that its *semantics* are clear. Live verification on risk
cases is the gate that catches semantic gaps. The finding doc records
forward design notes for every future H2 entry: explicit status routing,
risk-case enumeration, criterion-preservation test extension,
PROMPT_REGISTRY version bump.

### chg-3 — Hardening the eval against the judge variance the cycle predicted

iter-2 documented one judge-jitter case (GC-017 swinging 2 → 4 across
two runs). iter-3 chg-1's baseline-capture surfaced a second (GC-005
swinging 5 → 2 with the same-state agent re-investigation showing 5
again). Two cases producing ±2–3 score swings across same-state runs is
not isolated noise — it is a systematic property of LLM-as-judge
evaluation that PACCA's per-case regression gate would chase as false
positives without a tolerance band.

chg-3 adds the band. `check_regression` gains a `noise_threshold`
parameter (default `0` — preserves the strict iter-2 behavior for tests
that want it). `RegressionReport` gains a `jitter` field that records
drops within the noise band for transparency without blocking. The
production recommendation is `noise_threshold=1`: tolerate ±1 jitter,
surface ±2 swings as worth investigation. The recommendation is
documented in the function's docstring and is cited explicitly in the
chg-3 commit message and the iter-3 manifest.

The companion enhancement is `--rollouts N` on `capture_baseline.py`.
When set above 1, each case runs N times and the saved file includes both
the per-case median score AND the full distribution per case. The iter-3
final baseline was captured with `--rollouts 2`. The distributions show
**zero jitter in this capture** — every case scored identically across
both rollouts. The noise_threshold work is therefore prophylactic for
this iteration; it would have been reactive if iter-3 had landed without
it.

### The iteration's results, in one table

| Case | iter-2-final | iter-3 (median of 2 rollouts) | Δ | Cause |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GC-001 | 5 | 5 | 0 | iter-2 chg-6 case-def repair holding under H2 memory |
| GC-009 | 4 | 4 | 0 | (unchanged) |
| **GC-010** | **1** | **5** | **+4** | **chg-1 high_cost_check (predicted fix verified)** |
| **GC-012** | **2** | **4** | **+2** | **chg-1 pediatric_complex_check (predicted fix verified)** |
| GC-017 | 4 | 5 | +1 | jitter case stable in this rollout |
| GC-005 | 5 | 5 | 0 | jitter case stable in this rollout |
| GC-021 (near-miss) | IN_REVIEW (live gate) | IN_REVIEW + score 5 | — | H2 memory preserves discrimination after in-iteration fix |
| GC-022 (near-miss) | IN_REVIEW (live gate) | IN_REVIEW + score 3 | — | H2 memory preserves discrimination |
| All others | 5 | 5 | 0 | — |
| **Aggregate** | **18/20 = 90%** | **20/20 = 100%** | **+10 pp** | chg-1 fixes + chg-2 risk-preservation |

### Verdict on iter-2's predictions and risks

iter-2 shipped six changes. None of them predicted behavioral fixes
(they were all `evaluation_harness` or `instrumentation` scope), and
only chg-6 named a specific predicted_fix (GC-001 → ≥4 after case-def
repair). iter-3 verifies:

- **chg-1 (schema enum extensions):** non-behavioral. Confirmed keep —
  iter-3's chg-1 and chg-3 manifest entries validate against the
  extended enums.
- **chg-2 (regression_gate + iter-1 baseline):** iter-3 chg-3 enhances
  it without replacing. The gate caught both chg-1 fixes AND the
  judge-jitter false positives — exactly the contract. Confirmed keep.
- **chg-3 (near-miss cases + gate wiring):** GC-021 and GC-022 continue
  to route to IN_REVIEW at iter-3 HEAD with H2 memory active.
  Confirmed keep.
- **chg-4 (doc-drift guard + iter-0 reconciliation):** guard still
  passes; no new dangling references from iter-3's doc additions.
  Confirmed keep.
- **chg-5 (model SSOT):** every iter-3 evaluation ran against
  `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929` matching the manifest's `base_model`.
  Confirmed keep.
- **chg-6 (diagnostic findings + GC-001 case-def repair):** the
  predicted GC-001 fix (2 → ≥4) verified at iter-3 HEAD with the
  case-def repair holding under H2 memory active (score 5 across both
  rollouts). The GC-010 and GC-012 findings recorded as iter-3 design
  constraints both translated to predicted_fixes in iter-3 chg-1 and
  both verified live. Confirmed keep.

iter-2 is now fully closed with all six chgs verdict=keep.

### What success looks like for iter-4

Two threads worth pursuing in iter-4:

1. **Second H2 memory entry.** RA biologic after DMARD failure is the
   natural next pattern: GC-010 is the canonical case (now correctly
   escalating via chg-1's high_cost_check), and a memory entry would
   compress the clinical-eligibility reasoning while leaving the
   policy enforcement (cost) to ClinicalRiskDetector. Follow the
   forward design notes in
   [`docs/findings/H2-memory-iteration-1.md`](./findings/H2-memory-iteration-1.md):
   explicit status routing on every anti-pattern; risk-case
   enumeration; PROMPT_REGISTRY version bump.

2. **The dead-code deletion (`decision_agent.py`)** queued since iter-1.
   Standalone cleanup chg, bundles cheaply into any iter-4 path. iter-1
   recorded it in the manifest's deferred-findings section; it has
   waited long enough.

A third optional thread: **complexity-score model** for the
pediatric_complex check. iter-3 chg-1 uses a keyword heuristic on
`disease_severity` (per the conservative recommendation in
`docs/findings/GC-012.md`). When a second pediatric case forces the
distinction, that's the iteration to introduce a numeric
`complexity_score` using the `COMPLEXITY_AUTO_APPROVE_MAX` and
`COMPLEXITY_SPECIALIST_REVIEW_MIN` settings that already exist in
`.env` but nothing reads. Defer until the case exists.

### Reflection on cycle methodology

Three observations worth recording at iter-3's close.

**The eval-net-first sequencing earned out.** iter-2's hardening (per-case
regression gate, near-miss cases, doc-drift guard) all fired in iter-3
in the way the iter-2 narrative predicted. The regression gate flagged
chg-1's apparent GC-005 / GC-017 regressions; investigation proved them
to be judge jitter; chg-3 enhanced the gate so future runs distinguish
the classes. The near-miss cases caught the chg-2 mid-iteration regression
on GC-021; investigation proved the memory wording was the cause; the
fix landed in the same commit. The doc-drift guard remained green
throughout. None of this would have been visible if iter-3 had been the
first iteration to ship behavioral changes after iter-1's refactor.

**The cycle is now producing transferable design constraints, not just
metrics.** iter-2's findings docs (GC-001, GC-010, GC-012) prescribed
exactly what iter-3 chg-1 needed to build. The iter-3
[H2-memory-iteration-1.md](./findings/H2-memory-iteration-1.md) finding
prescribes what every future H2 entry must include. This is the
methodology becoming self-aware: each iteration's record is also a spec
fragment for the iterations that follow.

**Pre-commit's mypy strict mode revealed pre-existing tech debt that
iter-3 chg-1's py.typed marker unearthed.** Adding a PEP 561 marker made
mypy walk transitive imports across the pacca package; multiple
pre-existing untyped functions and one structlog-style stdlib-logger
call surfaced as errors. The right reflex was to fix them inline (TODO
comments where the fix is non-trivial, type annotations where it is)
rather than to roll back py.typed. The lesson: tooling hygiene
improvements are best landed *during* substantive iterations, where
their cost is amortized against meaningful work, rather than as
standalone "lint cleanup" commits that have no other forcing function.

### Files changed in this iteration

**Behavioral (agent surface modified):**
`src/pacca/agents/clinical_risk_detector.py` (chg-1: new check methods + parsers),
`src/pacca/agents/decision_support/long_term_memory.md` (chg-2: new),
`src/pacca/agents/_prompt_loader.py` (chg-2: memory injection),
`src/pacca/agents/decision_support/system_prompt.md` (chg-2: memory section),
`src/pacca/agents/prompts/templates.py` (chg-2: PROMPT_REGISTRY v2.2 → v2.3).

**Data model:** `src/pacca/models/clinical.py` (chg-1: three optional fields).

**Eval-net (no agent surface):**
`tests/clinical/regression_gate.py` (chg-3),
`tests/clinical/capture_baseline.py` (chg-3),
`tests/clinical/baselines/iter-3-chg1-baseline.json` (chg-1 verification),
`tests/clinical/baselines/iter-3-baseline.json` (chg-3 final),
`tests/harness/test_iter2_hardening.py` (chg-3: 8 new tests),
`tests/unit/test_escalation_high_cost_and_pediatric.py` (chg-1: 26 new tests),
`tests/unit/test_h2_memory_criterion_preservation.py` (chg-2: 19 new tests).

**Infrastructure surfaced and fixed in chg-1:**
`src/pacca/py.typed` (PEP 561 marker),
`src/pacca/config/tracing.py` (TODO-marked type-ignore on structlog-style logger calls),
`.pre-commit-config.yaml` (pydantic-settings added to mypy hook deps),
`tests/clinical/golden_cases.py`, `tests/clinical/evaluator.py` (pre-existing type-annotation fixes).

**Documentation:**
`docs/ITERATIONS.md` (iter-3 narrative — this section),
`docs/DECISIONS.md` (iter-3 per-chg + iteration verdict),
`docs/findings/H2-memory-iteration-1.md` (methodology finding),
`harness/manifests/iter-3.json` (structured manifest + verdicts on iter-2's 6 chgs),
`RUNBOOK_iter3.md` (committed at iteration start as the spec).

<a name="iter-2-eval-net-hardening"></a>
## iter-2 — Eval-Net Hardening, the boring iteration that earned its keep

**Tag:** `harness-iter-2`
**Phase:** H5 slice pulled forward (Evaluation Harness Expansion)
**Date:** 2026-05-22 (manifest) → 2026-05-24 (finalization)
**Changes:** 6 (`chg-1` schema; `chg-2` regression gate; `chg-3` near-miss cases + gate wiring; `chg-4` doc-drift guard + reconciliation; `chg-5` model SSOT; `chg-6` diagnostic findings + GC-001 repair)
**Eval delta:** zero behavioral change to any agent surface; aggregate clinical accuracy moved 80% → 90% via test-data correction only (chg-6 GC-001 stage IIIA → stage IV repair)

### What this iteration shipped

iter-2 is the cycle's first "no behavioral change to the agent" iteration. Five of the six changes harden the evaluation/measurement apparatus before the first agent-behavioral iteration (iter-3, Phase H2 institutional memory) lands. The sixth (`chg-5`) is a reproducibility fix to make `AgentConfig.model` derive from `settings.default_model` so the manifest's `base_model` field is no longer a polite fiction.

The pulled-forward Phase H5 slice has a specific charter: detect the *specific* failure modes that H2 is most likely to introduce, before H2 introduces them. Three known classes of failure are addressed by `chg-2` through `chg-4`:

- **Silent per-case degradation.** An over-aggressive memory entry can erode reasoning quality on every case while keeping decisions correct; the aggregate ≥80% gate would never fire. `chg-2` ships `regression_gate.py` and an iter-1 baseline scoreboard that compares each case's current score to its baseline and flags any drop — even when the aggregate stays green.

- **False pattern-matching.** Memory entries that compress to "shape of case → outcome" can fire on near-miss cases where one disqualifying detail would normally flip the outcome. `chg-3` introduces near-miss "memory-trap" siblings of GC-001 (PD-L1 45% below threshold; EGFR mutation present) that must NOT auto-approve. The existing 20 cases couldn't probe this.

- **Documentation drift.** The iter-0 records described a `src/pacca/observability/trajectory.py` file that never shipped; the real instrumentation is OTel spans in `agents/base.py`. `chg-4` adds a CI doc-drift guard, reconciles the iter-0 trajectory record via superseding entries (per the append-only protocol), and repoints two more drifts in HARNESS.md the guard found on its first run (escalation_tree.py → orchestrator.py; db/audit/schema.py → db/models.py AuditLogModel).

### The methodological choice the iteration tested

iter-2's most defensible decision was the *temporal* one: harden the eval net *before* the first behavioral change rather than *after*. The temptation is to ship H2 (the headline iteration — institutional memory, the AHE paper's highest-leverage single component at +5.6 pp on Terminal-Bench 2) immediately after iter-1 and call eval-net hardening a follow-up.

The AHE paper's regression-blindness finding (Lin et al., §4.4.2) is the argument against that order. Self-prediction of regressions sits at ~2x random precision while self-prediction of fixes sits at ~5x. The eval suite IS the safety net, and a safety net deployed after the first risk event is theatre. The whole reason iter-1 chg-1 was a refactor was to put one-file-per-component diffs in place; the parallel argument for iter-2 is to put per-case regression detection in place before any behavioral change can hide in the aggregate.

The decision paid off on the first real run.

### The first-run findings (the iteration's actual punchline)

The chg-2 baseline-capture script ran live against iter-2 HEAD (140 of 140 unit tests already green; this was the LLM-as-judge clinical run). It produced 17 of 20 passes for an aggregate of 85% — comfortably above the 80% gate. Three cases persistently failed. The eval-net hardening worked exactly as advertised: it surfaced bugs the aggregate gate would have ignored.

**GC-010 (high-cost biologic, score 1).** Per the evaluator rubric, score 1 is reserved for "critically wrong" — wrong decision, hallucination, or invented clinical detail. The agent's clinical reasoning on GC-010 is *exemplary* — every ACR 2021 biologic-DMARD criterion cited, step therapy correctly documented. What it missed is the `HIGH_COST_THRESHOLD` ($100K) escalation rule. Annual cost on this case is $288K. The pipeline's `branch_2_medical_director` was designed (per HARNESS.md) to catch this; in code, no component implements the cost check. Neither the `ClinicalRiskDetector` pre-flight nor the `DecisionAgent` system prompt knows the rule exists. The agent has no way to even consider it.

**GC-012 (pediatric severe asthma, score 2).** Same structural gap as GC-010 — `branch_2_medical_director` was meant to catch pediatric + complexity escalations. The `Settings` schema even exposes `COMPLEXITY_AUTO_APPROVE_MAX` and `COMPLEXITY_SPECIALIST_REVIEW_MIN`. No code consults them. The agent correctly notes the patient is 14 (meets the ≥12 age requirement for dupilumab) and approves. Two cases failing the same way is a *pattern*, not incidental: there's a systematic gap in branch_2_medical_director triggers.

**GC-001 (canonical NSCLC clean approve, score 2 — a different kind of finding entirely).** This one was the most surprising. GC-001 is the cleanest case in the dataset: NSCLC, pembrolizumab, PD-L1 62%, no EGFR/ALK, first-line, ECOG 1. Expected outcome `AUTO_APPROVED`. Yet the agent returned `INFORMATION_NEEDED` with a precise, well-reasoned explanation: the clinical notes documented *"stage IIIA"* (locally advanced) but the guidelines_context cited *"metastatic NSCLC"* requirements. The agent correctly noticed that stage IIIA is treated with curative-intent combined modality therapy, not first-line systemic monotherapy for metastatic disease. The judge then penalized the agent for being right.

The case definition had an internal contradiction. The author had set `expected_outcome=AUTO_APPROVED` based on the biomarker criteria (PD-L1 62%, no EGFR/ALK) without noticing the stage/guideline mismatch. **The agent's sophistication exceeded the test author's specification.** This is a positive finding about agent quality and a negative finding about the dataset.

### The repair that belonged in iter-2 vs the repairs that belong in iter-3

`chg-6` ships the only fix that fits at evaluation_harness scope: change GC-001's clinical_notes from "stage IIIA" to "stage IV (metastatic, M1c)". Test data only. No agent code or prompt touched. Predicted_fix: GC-001 flips 2 → ≥4. Verified live the same day: 2 → 5. The judge's reasoning text on the post-repair run explicitly cites "Stage IV (M1c) metastatic NSCLC" — exactly the criterion the fix was meant to enable.

The GC-010 and GC-012 fixes are **deliberately deferred to iter-3**. They require touching `ClinicalRiskDetector.evaluate()` and/or `decision_support/system_prompt.md` — both agent-surface changes that would violate iter-2's "no behavioral change" charter and would conflate iter-2's eval-net hardening with bug fixes. The findings are recorded as design constraints on iter-3 (see `docs/findings/GC-010.md` and `docs/findings/GC-012.md`):

- iter-3 must add a `high_cost_check` and a `pediatric_complexity_check` to `ClinicalRiskDetector`, both routing to `branch_2_medical_director`.
- iter-3 H2's institutional memory MUST NOT compress away the discriminations these checks enforce. A memory entry like "RA + abatacept after DMARD failure → approve" must encode the cost guard explicitly. A memory entry like "NSCLC + pembrolizumab + PD-L1 ≥50% → approve" must encode the stage and the full criteria set, not just the headline.

### One more finding: judge non-determinism

The chg-2 baseline-capture script ran once; the chg-6 reproducer (`investigate_case.py`) re-ran the same case (GC-010) with no agent change and produced a different judge score (1 vs 2 on different rolls). Same agent output (`correct_outcome=False` both times), different harshness. This is the cycle's first observed evidence of LLM-as-judge per-case variance, and it has direct consequences for `regression_gate.py`: the gate currently fires on *any* per-case drop, which would produce false-positive failures on ±1 jitter. A noise-threshold + k=2 rollouts enhancement is queued for iter-2-supplement or as the first chg of iter-3 — recorded in the spawned-tasks list and in `docs/findings/`.

### Verdict on iter-1's predictions

iter-1 chg-1's predicted_fixes was empty (refactor only) and risk_cases was empty (zero behavioral change predicted). Both fields trivially verified.

The substantive iter-1 verdict — that the H1 byte-identity guarantee survived intact at iter-2 HEAD — is confirmed by three independent gates:

- **Unit + harness suite:** 139 of 139 tests pass at iter-2 HEAD (~7s), unchanged from iter-1 with the iter-2 additions layered on.
- **Live clinical gate:** 3 of 3 clinical-marked tests pass in 339.52s with `GOLDEN_CASES + NEAR_MISS_CASES` exercised end-to-end. Aggregate accuracy passes the ≥80% gate; the near-miss cases route to IN_REVIEW (implied by the math — if GC-021 or GC-022 had auto-approved, the gate would have failed).
- **Doc-drift guard:** PASSED — every `src/*.py` reference in `docs/` resolves on disk.

iter-1's formal verdict in `docs/DECISIONS.md` is now **keep**, with the basis recorded.

### What success looks like for iter-3

iter-3 is the cycle's first behavioral-change iteration. Two design constraints inherited from iter-2's findings:

1. **Land the GC-010 / GC-012 escalation-branch fix first**, with its own `chg-` entry at `constraint_level: escalation_branch`. The findings docs in `docs/findings/` are the source-of-truth for what the fix has to do; bundle the two cases into one `chg-` because they're the same class of bug. Predicted_fixes: `["GC-010", "GC-012"]`. After landing, re-run capture_baseline.py to confirm both flip from below-threshold to ≥3.

2. **Then ship H2 institutional memory** with the design constraints from `docs/findings/`. Memory entries must encode the *full* set of conditions for their shortcuts — not just the headline indication. The byte-identity check pattern from iter-1 should be adapted to a "criterion preservation" check: when a memory entry compresses a case class, the agent's rationale on the compressed path must still cite every criterion the uncompressed path cited. Otherwise H2 would risk encoding the false shortcut GC-001 was originally testing.

The chg-1 dead-code observation from iter-1 (`decision_agent.py`, 330 lines, imported by no module) remains queued as a separate cleanup chg, foldable into either iter-3 path as a parallel commit.

### Reflection on cycle methodology

Two observations worth recording at iter-2's close, as calibration anchors for iter-3 and beyond.

**Eval-net hardening is the unglamorous but highest-leverage iteration.** iter-2 produced no behavioral change, no headline metric, and no LinkedIn post that says "we improved X by Y pp." What it produced is three real bugs (two SEV-2 escalation gaps and one test-data inconsistency), one signed-and-dated finding doc per bug, design constraints attached to iter-3, and a regression gate that will catch the *next* round of bugs the same way. The temptation to skip this iteration in favor of H2's behavioral splash was real and was wrong. The cycle is now positioned to ship H2 with the safety net deployed *before* the risk event.

**The agent is more sophisticated than its evaluators.** GC-001 was supposed to be the trivial case. The agent caught a real internal contradiction in the test data that the test author hadn't noticed. The methodological lesson: when the agent and the judge disagree on a "trivial" case, look at the case definition before looking at the agent. This pattern will likely recur. The `docs/findings/` directory is the right place to record each instance.

<a name="iter-1-component-decoupling"></a>
## iter-1 — Component Decoupling, first extraction

**Tag:** `harness-iter-1`
**Phase:** H1 (Component Decoupling)
**Date:** 2026-05-04
**Merged commit:** `a72249a`
**Files changed:** 7 (+291 / -24 lines)
**Eval delta:** zero behavioral change (refactor only); byte-identity verified pre-merge

### What this iteration shipped

iter-1 is the cycle's first behavioral commit, and intentionally a refactor. The agent-specific bodies of `DECISION_AGENT_SYSTEM` and `MEDICAL_DIRECTOR_AGENT_SYSTEM` were moved out of f-string constants in `prompts/templates.py` and into file-level mount points at `src/pacca/agents/<agent>/system_prompt.md`. A Jinja2 loader (`_prompt_loader.py`) assembles each prompt at runtime from the per-agent `.md` file plus the shared components (`AGENT_IDENTITY`, `CLINICAL_SAFETY_GUIDELINES`, `OUTPUT_FORMAT_INSTRUCTIONS`) which remain canonical in `templates.py`. The `DecisionAgent` and `MedicalDirectorAgent` classes in `decision.py` were rewired to use the loader.

The H1 success criterion is the AHE paper's `paragraph_2 == paragraph_2` bar: byte-identical prompt output before and after extraction. We hit that criterion. The work was structural; no clinical case was targeted, no behavioral gain was predicted, and no behavioral change was observed in the test suite (120 of 120 collectable tests passing, identical to iter-0).

### The architectural ambiguity that defined the work

The iteration began by trying to identify the right extraction target. Two files in `src/pacca/agents/` claimed similar names: `decision_agent.py` (330 lines) and `decision.py` (194 lines). Both defined classes consistent with the Decision Support Agent role. Neither file's name made it obvious which one the runtime actually used.

The investigation took longer than the extraction itself. Three diagnostic commands surfaced the answer: the orchestrator imports `DecisionAgent` from `decision.py`, not from `decision_agent.py`; tests reference the *string* `"DecisionSupportAgent"` (which is what `decision.py`'s `name()` method returns); no module anywhere imports `decision_agent.py`'s class. The 330-line file is dead code — likely a partial migration target that was never cleaned up.

This finding was deliberately not addressed in chg-1. The methodology calls for one logical change per commit; deleting the dead file is its own commit (queued as chg-2). What chg-1 *did* record was the finding itself, in the manifest's `observed_findings_deferred` array, so the dead-code observation has a durable home even though the deletion waits for its own commit.

A second architectural finding emerged during the same investigation: `decision.py` houses both `DecisionAgent` (Tier 1) and `MedicalDirectorAgent` (Tier 2) in a single Python module. The HARNESS.md vocabulary assumes one agent per directory, which would have implied splitting `decision.py`. We chose instead to extract both prompts to separate `.md` mount points without restructuring the class layout — a Path B that adds the file-level editability that H1 requires while leaving the Python class structure intact. That's a smaller, lower-risk change than the directory split would have been, and the LinkedIn post for iter-1 will be more credible because of the restraint than it would have been with a more ambitious restructure.

### The byte-identity verification was the work

The H1 success criterion is unambiguous: every prompt token sent to Claude must match what the f-string version produced. A character-level drift would mean the rendered prompts differ, the Claude responses differ, the test suite that compares `DECISION_AGENT_SYSTEM` content fails, and the iter-1 manifest's "zero behavioral change" claim becomes false on the public record.

Rather than ship and hope, we built a small Python script (`/tmp/byte_identity_check.py`) that imported both the existing f-string constants and the new loader output, compared them character-by-character, and printed the first divergence with 30 characters of context on each side. This script ran *before* `decision.py` was modified to use the loader, so any miss would be caught at the verification gate, not in the runtime path.

The first run failed. The Decision Support `system_prompt.md` was missing a blank line between the role section and the safety guidelines block. The byte-identity check showed: expected `\n\n\n## Clinical Safety Guidelines`, actual `\n\n## Clinical Safety Guidelines`. One missing newline. Cascading effect: 893 characters of difference, every line shifted relative to baseline.

The fix was a one-character correction (literally one missing `\n`). The check passed on the second run. Both prompts confirmed byte-identical to the pre-H1 baseline. The runtime wiring was then safe to proceed.

This is the regression-blindness safety net the AHE paper warns about, applied at the byte level rather than at the case level. The local test suite would not have caught the missing newline — `tests/unit/test_prompt_engineering.py` checks for *content presence* (does the prompt contain the precedent-weighting language?), not for *exact string equality*. A character-level drift could have shipped past the test suite and into production. The byte-identity check was the right tool for the right gate.

### Three rounds of CI feedback that taught the cycle

Local tests passed at 120 of 120. The first PR-CI run failed with a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'jinja2'`. Locally we had installed jinja2 manually after the first import error in our own venv; we never circled back to declare it in `pyproject.toml`. CI ran against `pip install -e .` from a clean environment, hit the missing declaration, and failed the test job before any test could run.

The fix was one line in `pyproject.toml`. After force-pushing the amendment, CI advanced from "broken at collection" to "97 of 98 passing, 1 failed." The remaining failure was `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'jose'` — exactly one of the deferred findings from chg-1's original manifest. The pyproject.toml/requirements.txt manifest divergence had bitten us mid-iteration.

This is the moment where I (the AI assistant) recommended a methodology recalibration to David. The original deferral plan said: keep `python-jose` and `bcrypt` for their own dedicated commit. That principle is sound when the dependency issue is unrelated to chg-1's scope. But chg-1 itself surfaced the dependency surface (by introducing `jinja2`), and the same CI run revealed all three missing declarations. Splitting them across commits would have meant landing chg-1 with a known broken CI for an issue we already knew how to fix.

We bundled all three (`jinja2`, `python-jose`, `bcrypt`) into chg-1's pyproject.toml amendment. The chg-1 narrative grew slightly: "extracted prompts; fixed pyproject.toml dependency declarations including the new one introduced by this commit." The deferred-findings list shrank from three to two. The methodology principle still held — every change had clear attribution — but the unit of "one logical change" expanded to include "make pyproject.toml accurately describe what the runtime needs," which was the right scope for this specific situation.

The third CI cycle revealed another finding: the change manifest schema's files-path pattern was too strict. The pattern `^(src/pacca/|harness/|docs/|tests/)` rejected `pyproject.toml` because root-level config files don't match any of the allowed roots. The schema we wrote in iter-0 was too narrow for what real harness changes need. We extended the pattern to include repo-root config files (`pyproject.toml`, `requirements*.txt`, `setup.py/cfg`, `Dockerfile`, `.gitignore`, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `LICENSE`, `Makefile`) and CI workflows under `.github/`. Also generalized `src/pacca/` to `src/` since the project-specific prefix was unnecessary.

This last change is the one that most clearly demonstrates the methodology working as designed. Schema constraints written upfront age into discoveries during real iteration; the discoveries age into improvements. The schema is now more accurate because chg-1 forced us to use it for a case the iter-0 author hadn't anticipated. This pattern will recur — schema evolution alongside content evolution, both recorded — and the iter-2 verdict on chg-1 will reference both the prompt extraction and the schema broadening as bundled deliverables.

### What the cycle internalized

Three lessons for future iterations:

**Investigate before extracting.** The 30 minutes spent identifying which decision file was canonical (and which was dead code) was non-negotiable. A naive extraction from `decision_agent.py` would have produced a working `.md` file that the runtime never read; we would have shipped a refactor that changed nothing in production and recorded a false success. The diagnostic phase is not optional and should be the first item in any future H1-style extraction.

**Build the byte-level safety net before modifying the runtime.** The byte-identity check was the highest-leverage tool of the iteration. It caught one real bug pre-merge, validated the loader against the canonical baseline, and produced a reusable template (`/tmp/byte_identity_check.py`) for future agent extractions. Subsequent H1 commits — Evidence Aggregation, Clinical Classification, Policy Evolution — should adopt the same pattern.

**Defer plans are revisable when CI surfaces dependencies.** The "one logical change per commit" principle is sound, but it's a heuristic, not a constitution. When chg-1's CI run made three dependency declarations visible at the same moment, bundling them into chg-1 was the right scope. The defer plan in the manifest is a planning artifact, not a commitment device — the methodology values shipping clean over enforcing the original plan rigidly.

### What success looks like for iter-2

iter-2 is the next iteration in the cycle, and it has two plausible candidates depending on what we want to demonstrate next:

- **Phase H1 continuation:** extract the next agent (likely Evidence Aggregation, since its prompt is simpler than Decision Support) using the loader pattern established here. Lower-risk than chg-1 because the byte-identity gate is now a known-good template; should land faster.

- **Phase H2 first move:** introduce the `long_term_memory.md` layer for the Decision Support agent. This is the AHE paper's highest-leverage component (+5.6 pp single-component gain on Terminal-Bench 2) and is the iteration most likely to produce the cycle's first real behavioral delta.

H2 is more strategically important; H1 continuation is operationally easier. The choice depends on whether iter-2 should optimize for risk reduction (H1 continuation) or for the cycle's first behavioral gain (H2 start). My current lean: H2, because the iter-2 LinkedIn post is the post that tests the AHE paper's transferability claim and that's the post that does the most portfolio work.

The chg-2 dead-code deletion (`decision_agent.py` removal) is small enough to bundle into either path as a parallel cleanup commit. It does not need its own iteration.

### Verdict on iter-1's predictions

iter-1's predicted_fixes list was empty (refactor only). risk_cases was also empty (zero behavioral change predicted). The byte-identity check and the green test suite (120 of 120 local; 97 of 97 collectable in CI post-merge, with 23 tests skipped due to external service requirements unrelated to this PR) provide strong prior evidence that the formal verdict from iter-2 will be `keep`. The verdict block in DECISIONS.md will be filled when iter-2's evaluation completes.

One small note for the iter-2 verdict: the test count discrepancy between local (120) and CI (97 + 23 skipped) is not a regression; it's environmental. CI runs without the external services some integration tests require. This will be a recurring pattern across iterations and is worth recording so future verdicts don't flag it as a change.

**Tag:** `harness-iter-0`
**Companion tag:** `pre-ahe-baseline`
**Phase:** H0 (Baseline Crystallization)
**Date:** *(populated when shipped)*
**Eval delta:** n/a — iter-0 has no predictions to verify

### What this iteration shipped

iter-0 is the cycle's anchor. It ships no behavioral change; what it ships is the measurement infrastructure that every subsequent iteration is measured against. Specifically:

- **Trajectory instrumentation** at `src/pacca/observability/trajectory.py`. Every agent step now emits a structured JSON record capturing input, tool calls, output, confidence, and escalation decision. These records are the substrate that Phase H4's manifest verdicts and Phase H5's benchmark expansion will both consume.

- **Change manifest schema** at `harness/manifests/change_manifest.schema.json`. JSON Schema 2020-12 specification with eleven valid `constraint_level` values, healthcare-specific fields (`phi_impact`, `audit_relevant`), and a verdict sub-schema for next-iteration validation.

- **Four documentation files**: `HARNESS.md` (architectural reference), `DECISIONS.md` (this file's audit-log companion), `ITERATIONS.md` (this file), and an updated `README.md` positioning v2.3 as a methodology adoption rather than a feature drop.

The two paired tags — `harness-iter-0` and `pre-ahe-baseline` — point at the same commit. The duplication is deliberate: `harness-iter-0` is the engineering record (the iteration counter), and `pre-ahe-baseline` is the operational record (the rollback target). Different audiences look for different names, and both should find the right tag without effort.

### Why the seed is intentionally minimal

The AHE paper (Lin et al. §3.1) frames this same choice clearly: "A seed already fitted to the target benchmark would contaminate every subsequent edit's attribution, since we could not tell whether a gain came from the loop or from the seed."

PACCA's v2.2.0 is not a "minimal" harness in absolute terms — it has 5 agents, a 7-branch escalation tree, dual-collection RAG, and 140 unit tests. But for the purposes of the v2.3 cycle, v2.2.0 is the seed. The cycle does not retroactively re-attribute any v2.2.0 capability to the cycle's work. iter-0's job is to draw the line between "what existed before" and "what the cycle produced."

Operationally, this matters because the cycle's claims depend on it. When iter-3 claims that institutional memory contributed +X pp to pass@1, that claim is only credible because there is a `harness-iter-0` reference state without the institutional memory layer. The seed makes the attribution falsifiable.

### Baseline trajectory pattern

Even without a behavioral change, iter-0 captures a baseline trajectory that frames the cycle's starting point. Three observations from running the 53-case demo dataset against the v2.2.0 system, recorded immediately after tagging:

**Decision Support Agent's reasoning is mostly clean but verbose.** On Group A (auto-approve) cases, the agent typically takes 4–6 reasoning steps before finalizing a decision, even when the case clearly aligns with cited NCCN guidelines. The verbosity itself is not a failure pattern — confidence remains ≥0.95 — but it suggests an opportunity for Phase H2's institutional memory layer to encode "for clear PD-L1 ≥50% NSCLC cases with documented disease stage and PD-L1 testing date, summarize alignment to NCCN-NSCLC-PEMBRO-1L in 2 steps not 5."

**The Frontline → Medical Director handoff is occasionally lossy.** On two Group C cases (cost > $100K cases), the trajectory log shows Frontline emitting a clean rationale that Medical Director then partially restates rather than building on. Both cases pass the eval, but the redundancy is a hint that Phase H1's tool-description extraction may need to expose a structured handoff payload rather than relying on free-text rationale.

**The 7-branch escalation tree's pre-flight checks fire correctly but silently.** Group D (experimental treatment) cases are correctly routed to human review without LLM invocation, which is the design. But the trajectory log entries for these cases are sparse — they record "Branch 4 fired, routed to human" without capturing *why* the experimental treatment classifier matched. Phase H0's instrumentation enrichment plan includes adding a `pre_flight_evidence` field to these trajectory entries so a reviewer can audit the classifier's reasoning, not just its conclusion.

None of these observations are failure patterns in the manifest sense — they are not associated with failed cases. They are signals that Phase H1, H2, and H3 should pay attention to specific structural opportunities even before the full benchmark expansion in H5 makes them quantitatively actionable.

### Baseline numbers

The full numerical baseline is in [`docs/DECISIONS.md`](./DECISIONS.md#iter-0-baseline-crystallization) (iter-0 entry). The headline numbers, recorded for narrative continuity:

- **Unit tests:** 140 passing, 0 failing, ~8 seconds
- **Demo dataset:** 53 cases across 8 groups (A–H), all 7 escalation branches exercised
- **Clinical golden dataset:** 20 cases with LLM-as-judge scoring, ≥80% accuracy gate passing
- **Hallucination zero-tolerance gate:** passing on GC-018, GC-019
- **Pass@1 on unified benchmark:** to be populated after Phase H5 unifies the case sources

The "to be populated" entry is honest reporting. Phase H5 is the phase where pass@1 becomes the headline metric; until then, the cycle reports unit tests and per-source pass rates separately.

### What success looks like for iter-1

iter-1 is the first iteration that ships behavioral changes (extracted system prompts, tool descriptions, tool implementations under Phase H1). The success criterion for iter-1 is narrow and specific: full-suite reproduction of iter-0's baseline numbers with zero regression. Phase H1 is a refactor; if it produces any behavioral change, that change is a bug, not a feature.

The trickiest part of iter-1 will be the Jinja2 prompt rendering: the existing Python string prompts use f-string interpolation in places that don't translate cleanly to Jinja2 placeholders. The trajectory comparison check at iter-1's evaluation will catch any rendering discrepancy that produces a different prompt token sequence than the v2.2.0 baseline — even if the LLM happens to produce the same output.

This is why iter-1 is a conservative iteration. Phase H1 enables Phases H2 and H3 by making one-file diffs possible. The behavioral wins begin at iter-2.

### Reflection on cycle methodology

One observation worth recording at the cycle's start, as a calibration anchor for future iterations:

The AHE paper's empirical regression-blindness finding (Lin et al. §4.4.2) — that self-prediction of regressions sits at ~2x random precision while self-prediction of fixes sits at ~5x random — is the single most important calibration to internalize. Every prediction this cycle commits to in `risk_cases` should be treated as a low-confidence claim. The eval suite is the safety net. The honest verdict, including the misses, is what makes the methodology defensible.

The corollary: if the eval suite isn't catching regressions the manifest fails to predict, the eval suite is the bottleneck, not the methodology. Phase H5 exists specifically to address this. iter-0 ships with the existing eval coverage; the cycle's commitment is to expand it before iterations start producing claims that depend on it.

## Format reference

Each iteration's narrative section follows this structure:

1. **Header block** — tag, companion tag (if any), phase, date, eval delta
2. **What this iteration shipped** — brief summary of the changes made, with cross-references to DECISIONS.md and the manifest file
3. **Trajectory before/after** — for each major change, a representative case showing the failing trajectory pre-change and the passing trajectory post-change, in the AHE paper Appendix C three-column format
4. **Eval delta** — the numerical outcome: pass@1 change, tokens/case change, fix-precision and regression-recall against the iteration's predictions
5. **Verdict summary** — outcome verdicts on the previous iteration's predictions, with brief commentary on the misses (the misses are the most informative content)
6. **Reflection** — calibration notes for future iterations: what the cycle learned about its own prediction reliability, what the eval suite caught that the manifest didn't, what surprised the author

The reflection section is what distinguishes this log from a release-notes file. Release notes describe what shipped; reflection describes what we learned about how we ship.

## On narrative honesty

The AHE paper's case studies in Appendix C have one feature most release notes lack: they describe the failures *as failures*, including the failures that the cycle's self-attribution failed to predict. The iteration-7 narrative (Lin et al. C.1.4) is particularly clear on this — it describes a case where the iteration-6 middleware emitted the right warnings but the agent ignored them because the warnings landed in tool output rather than model context. The fix in iteration-8 was to promote the warnings to a `BeforeModelHook`. The narrative does not gloss over the iteration-6 mistake; it names it and uses it.

PACCA's iteration narratives commit to the same standard. When an iteration's verdict comes back negative, this file describes what went wrong and why the constraint level was misjudged — not as confession, but as the most useful content for the next iteration to read.
